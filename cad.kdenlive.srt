00:19:56,803 --> 00:19:58,993
Greetings and welcome back to the third

2
00:19:58,993 --> 00:20:01,483
section of my online class ‘CAD for

3
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:04,273
Gardeners’ and this is shapes, entities and

4
00:20:04,273 --> 00:20:06,433
mods, you can just about see

5
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:08,473
the mods, my face is nearly covering

6
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,723
it, and here I’m going to be

7
00:20:10,723 --> 00:20:14,863
looking at four basic shapes, three entity

8
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:16,693
types and then four modifications

9
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:18,703
that you can make. And using

10
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:21,913
these tools, you can create a whole

11
00:20:21,943 --> 00:20:26,533
infinite variety of different designs, hopefully. First

12
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:28,423
of all, before going further, I wanted

13
00:20:28,423 --> 00:20:31,273
to say about finding your way

14
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,073
around QCAD because it can be a

15
00:20:33,073 --> 00:20:34,513
little bit confusing. So I’m just going

16
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:36,523
to zip over to QCAD

17
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,153
I’ll create a new file, I’m

18
00:20:40,153 --> 00:20:41,533
just going to create a circle and

19
00:20:41,647 --> 00:20:43,573
really worry too much about what I’m

20
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:44,083
doing here…

21
00:20:45,973 --> 00:20:47,803
The great thing as I said before

22
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:49,543
about QCAD is that you can

23
00:20:49,543 --> 00:20:51,673
zoom in and you can zoom out

24
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:54,433
and it can be two hundred miles

25
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:56,473
wide or it can be twenty centimetres

26
00:20:56,473 --> 00:20:59,413
wide. The QCAD doesn’t really matter

27
00:20:59,413 --> 00:21:01,003
it’s kind of 1:1 scale

28
00:21:01,003 --> 00:21:02,923
and you work at whatever size

29
00:21:02,953 --> 00:21:04,243
the thing is that you’re working on

30
00:21:05,113 --> 00:21:05,413
Erm…

31
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:08,563
so for zooming in, zooming out, there’s

32
00:21:08,563 --> 00:21:10,543
the mouse scroll. Sorry, that’s a really

33
00:21:10,543 --> 00:21:12,493
really bad pun. That is a mouse

34
00:21:12,643 --> 00:21:14,383
with a scroll, took ages to

35
00:21:14,383 --> 00:21:16,993
find that one. Mouse scroll will zoom

36
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:18,313
you in and out so the mouse

37
00:21:18,313 --> 00:21:20,593
scroll is that button there and that

38
00:21:20,803 --> 00:21:23,383
will zoom you in and out in CAD. The plus

39
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:24,973
or minus keys on your keyboard

40
00:21:26,293 --> 00:21:28,273
Snd then if you get lost, it’s

41
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:32,383
`View > Zoom > Auto Zoom` and that will

42
00:21:32,563 --> 00:21:33,853
get you back to where

43
00:21:33,853 --> 00:21:35,473
your drawing is. I’ll just show you what

44
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:36,913
I mean. So mouse scroll first of

45
00:21:36,913 --> 00:21:39,193
all, so mouse scroll, zoom in and

46
00:21:39,193 --> 00:21:40,513
you can zoom in, zoom in and

47
00:21:40,513 --> 00:21:42,823
zoom in and zoom in and and

48
00:21:42,823 --> 00:21:45,103
it’s just incredible how much you

49
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:45,733
can zoom in

50
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:48,343
until your screen is filled with

51
00:21:48,343 --> 00:21:50,803
a line. Then you can zoom out

52
00:21:50,803 --> 00:21:52,303
as well and you can zoom out

53
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:54,373
and the problem with this zooming

54
00:21:54,373 --> 00:21:55,933
in, zooming out, plus minus keys

55
00:21:57,103 --> 00:22:00,973
minus, plus… oopsie, the problem

56
00:22:00,973 --> 00:22:02,593
is, it’s actually really really easy to

57
00:22:02,593 --> 00:22:04,693
get lost and I’ve got no idea

58
00:22:04,903 --> 00:22:07,363
where my circle’s gone. So if you

59
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:11,653
go to `View` menu and then `Zoom`

60
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:15,703
and zoom auto, `Auto Zoom` which has

61
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,113
`ZA` as the

62
00:22:17,263 --> 00:22:19,573
keyboard shortcut. It’s kinda nice to use

63
00:22:19,573 --> 00:22:21,403
keyboard shortcuts because it speeds things up

64
00:22:21,403 --> 00:22:23,533
but don’t worry about it. So click

65
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:26,743
on `Auto Zoom`, wmf, it brings your

66
00:22:26,743 --> 00:22:28,933
drawing into full view. So if you’re

67
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:30,553
zooming in and zooming out, you don’t

68
00:22:30,553 --> 00:22:33,763
know where you are, click `View > Zoom >

69
00:22:34,063 --> 00:22:36,193
Auto Zoom` and it brings you straight

70
00:22:36,193 --> 00:22:37,333
back. I’ll just do it again, `View >

71
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:40,363
Zoom > Auto Zoom` it brings you

72
00:22:40,363 --> 00:22:44,833
straight back. Okay? The next

73
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:47,443
thing is panning, so with panning

74
00:22:48,643 --> 00:22:50,413
that means kind of scrubbing or

75
00:22:50,443 --> 00:22:52,873
moving across the screen

76
00:22:53,203 --> 00:22:55,123
So that’s a mouse scroll click, so

77
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,853
again the mouse scroll button and then click

78
00:22:57,853 --> 00:22:59,503
it down and then you

79
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:02,023
can pan around the document

80
00:23:02,413 --> 00:23:06,223
or `View > Zoom > Pan Zoom`, so holding

81
00:23:06,223 --> 00:23:07,573
down the mouse scroll you know

82
00:23:07,573 --> 00:23:08,773
you can

83
00:23:08,893 --> 00:23:12,373
pan across like that or `View > Zoom >

84
00:23:12,613 --> 00:23:14,803
Pan Zoom` and that enables you to

85
00:23:15,673 --> 00:23:17,113
scroll down and get really really dizzy

86
00:23:17,323 --> 00:23:19,363
So the next bit that I wanted

87
00:23:19,363 --> 00:23:21,853
to show you was what what happens

88
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:25,153
if you kind of get lost at all

89
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:28,123
The thing to remember, is don’t

90
00:23:28,123 --> 00:23:28,663
panic

91
00:23:28,963 --> 00:23:31,423
So there’s two ways that I can

92
00:23:31,423 --> 00:23:33,223
get lost. Firstly, as I said before

93
00:23:33,463 --> 00:23:37,483
is zooming and zooming out, so

94
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:40,303
that’s `View > Zoom > Auto Zoom`, so if

95
00:23:40,303 --> 00:23:41,563
I don’t know where I am and

96
00:23:41,623 --> 00:23:44,833
I can’t see anything, `ZA`, bof!

97
00:23:44,893 --> 00:23:46,873
Brings it straight back. The other thing

98
00:23:46,873 --> 00:23:49,033
is, if I’ve started clicking on different

99
00:23:49,093 --> 00:23:50,923
tools and I don’t know how to

100
00:23:50,923 --> 00:23:53,173
get back to the pointer, just hit

101
00:23:53,173 --> 00:23:55,153
the escape key and that returns you

102
00:23:55,483 --> 00:23:57,703
to the arrow tool. So, just keep

103
00:23:57,703 --> 00:23:59,443
hitting it and eventually you’ll get back

104
00:23:59,443 --> 00:24:00,853
to the pointer tool and

105
00:24:00,853 --> 00:24:02,983
then get back to square one, okay

106
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,473
So those two tools are really really useful

107
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:07,276
to get back to

108
00:24:07,276 --> 00:24:08,713
your drawing and also to get back

109
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:09,253
to your arrow

110
00:24:09,294 --> 00:24:12,343
Right, so next up is shapes

111
00:24:12,373 --> 00:24:15,313
entities and mods. As I said, four

112
00:24:15,313 --> 00:24:18,193
shapes, three entities and four mods. What

113
00:24:18,193 --> 00:24:19,663
you want to do, press the `P`

114
00:24:19,663 --> 00:24:22,483
key again, you want to download the files

115
00:24:22,513 --> 00:24:25,153
from here. This is the CAD

116
00:24:25,153 --> 00:24:27,913
gardener’s files and I’ll just show you

117
00:24:28,513 --> 00:24:29,353
where you get them from

118
00:24:29,413 --> 00:24:31,363
So this is where the files are

119
00:24:31,363 --> 00:24:34,243
stored and the files are in a

120
00:24:34,243 --> 00:24:36,703
folder called `cad-shapes-entities-mods`, probably

121
00:24:36,703 --> 00:24:38,143
the easiest thing to do is download them

122
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,673
altogether, so if you click on the

123
00:24:39,703 --> 00:24:42,583
`Code` button and then `Download zip`, unzip

124
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:43,753
it and then you’ve got the CAD

125
00:24:43,753 --> 00:24:45,133
files that you can play around with

126
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:46,513
First thing then that we’re going to

127
00:24:46,513 --> 00:24:46,843
do

128
00:24:47,983 --> 00:24:50,083
is to look at creating the four

129
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:52,663
shapes. So you’ve got a rectangle, line

130
00:24:52,693 --> 00:24:55,243
tool, circles for trees and NURBS for

131
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:59,413
curves. How terribly exciting. So rectangle is under

132
00:24:59,413 --> 00:25:01,513
the `Shape Tools` in the

133
00:25:01,513 --> 00:25:03,973
toolbar menu and the two rectangles that I

134
00:25:03,973 --> 00:25:06,103
use all the time, there’s like one

135
00:25:06,103 --> 00:25:08,053
which is just drawing a rectangle, so

136
00:25:08,143 --> 00:25:09,043
yeah, I know that it

137
00:25:10,423 --> 00:25:11,473
will be drawn like that

138
00:25:12,643 --> 00:25:14,713
Hit escape key, back for the pointer and

139
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,243
it draws a rectangle

140
00:25:16,303 --> 00:25:17,353
made out of lines

141
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:21,163
And the other one that I use

142
00:25:21,793 --> 00:25:24,733
probably a lot more, is the rectangle

143
00:25:24,763 --> 00:25:26,563
with size and this is actually really

144
00:25:26,563 --> 00:25:28,993
useful. So say I’ve got a, oh I don’t

145
00:25:28,993 --> 00:25:31,963
know, I’ve got a shed that’s

146
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,363
3 metres by 2 metres

147
00:25:36,313 --> 00:25:37,783
I kind of just put the size

148
00:25:37,783 --> 00:25:39,103
in, along the top here

149
00:25:40,243 --> 00:25:42,223
and then there we go, it’s

150
00:25:42,253 --> 00:25:44,561
a shed which is fantastic. So

151
00:25:44,561 --> 00:25:46,963
that’s a rectangle tool. We use rectangles

152
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:49,033
mostly for structures in a garden, so

153
00:25:49,063 --> 00:25:51,583
sheds, some polytunnels and steps and

154
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:54,913
stuff like that. The next tool is

155
00:25:54,943 --> 00:25:57,553
the line tool. So hit `Escape` to go

156
00:25:57,553 --> 00:26:00,043
back to the arrow tool

157
00:26:00,553 --> 00:26:02,593
click on `Line Tools` and I only ever

158
00:26:02,593 --> 00:26:04,933
use one line tool and that is

159
00:26:04,933 --> 00:26:06,823
this one here, which is `Line from

160
00:26:06,823 --> 00:26:09,313
2 Points`. And I just go… pom-ti-dom…

161
00:26:09,313 --> 00:26:12,313
create a line like

162
00:26:12,313 --> 00:26:14,953
that. And a line tools good for kind

163
00:26:14,953 --> 00:26:19,501
of irregular non-rectilinear shapes and it’s also

164
00:26:19,543 --> 00:26:20,533
really really good for

165
00:26:20,533 --> 00:26:21,583
for creating

166
00:26:23,383 --> 00:26:25,813
paths, for example, so you don’t have

167
00:26:25,813 --> 00:26:27,193
to use NURBS, you don’t have to

168
00:26:27,193 --> 00:26:28,753
create curvy paths, if you

169
00:26:28,813 --> 00:26:30,943
want to just for quickness

170
00:26:30,943 --> 00:26:33,403
you can create a basic path like

171
00:26:33,403 --> 00:26:36,313
that, yeah, so that’s the kind of

172
00:26:36,313 --> 00:26:37,393
thing that you can use it for

173
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:39,403
as well. And then creating boundaries. I’ll

174
00:26:39,403 --> 00:26:40,573
be going through all these when I

175
00:26:40,573 --> 00:26:42,073
do the examples as well, to give

176
00:26:42,073 --> 00:26:42,793
you some real world

177
00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:46,213
examples. The third shape is

178
00:26:46,243 --> 00:26:50,525
a circle and again, the circle tool, and

179
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,153
I only ever create, it’s all

180
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:54,133
these different options, it’s mind blowing

181
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:56,053
how many different options there are and what

182
00:26:56,053 --> 00:26:58,033
you can do with them and tangents

183
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,439
and all sorts of stuff, but I

184
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:01,063
only ever use one circle and that’s

185
00:27:01,063 --> 00:27:03,013
circles for trees, so you click

186
00:27:03,013 --> 00:27:03,283
there

187
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:08,113
we go, and that tool is called

188
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:10,123
let’s just make sure I’ve got the right name, `Center

189
00:27:10,183 --> 00:27:12,043
Point`, so you draw a circle from the

190
00:27:12,043 --> 00:27:14,563
point and there we go and you

191
00:27:14,563 --> 00:27:16,873
can just draw circles for trees. And this

192
00:27:16,873 --> 00:27:18,913
is where the `Property` widget comes in

193
00:27:18,943 --> 00:27:21,103
really really handy because what you can

194
00:27:21,103 --> 00:27:24,193
do, select the shape and then say

195
00:27:24,493 --> 00:27:24,613
oh

196
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:26,863
I don’t know, there’s a Sweet Chestnut

197
00:27:26,893 --> 00:27:30,673
is roughly 15 metres diameter, if you

198
00:27:30,673 --> 00:27:33,673
look in the `Property Editor` under diameter

199
00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:36,343
down here on the right hand side

200
00:27:36,733 --> 00:27:39,283
and then type in 15, there you

201
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:42,103
go, that’s the diameter of a Sweet

202
00:27:42,103 --> 00:27:44,377
Chestnut. And then I can say ‘Oh

203
00:27:44,385 --> 00:27:45,763
right then, I want to create another

204
00:27:45,763 --> 00:27:47,893
one’. And this is going to be

205
00:27:47,893 --> 00:27:50,263
4 metres wide because that’s the diameter

206
00:27:50,773 --> 00:27:53,983
Select, draw the circle, select it, diameter

207
00:27:54,103 --> 00:27:54,793
4

208
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,123
And that’s the diameter of an apple

209
00:27:58,123 --> 00:28:00,043
tree on an MM106

210
00:28:00,043 --> 00:28:03,433
rootstock, for example. So now you’ve got

211
00:28:03,523 --> 00:28:05,293
circles for trees, and then you can

212
00:28:05,293 --> 00:28:07,423
work out, using the tree spacing, you

213
00:28:07,423 --> 00:28:10,963
can calculate the distance actually it

214
00:28:10,963 --> 00:28:12,433
should be between the trees. And

215
00:28:12,433 --> 00:28:15,013
finally, NURBS. I wasn't going to show

216
00:28:15,013 --> 00:28:16,813
show you NURBS but they’re so great

217
00:28:16,813 --> 00:28:18,103
that’s such a brilliant name, it

218
00:28:18,103 --> 00:28:21,463
stands for Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines

219
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:23,503
I think. Have a play and

220
00:28:23,503 --> 00:28:24,583
if you like them and get on

221
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:26,413
with them, then use them. Again, I only

222
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,183
ever use one spline tool, this one

223
00:28:28,183 --> 00:28:30,523
at the top, spline with control points

224
00:28:31,603 --> 00:28:36,913
And you can click, click, click, double-

225
00:28:36,913 --> 00:28:39,793
click to stop the drawing, escape

226
00:28:39,853 --> 00:28:41,293
to get the arrow tool back and

227
00:28:41,293 --> 00:28:44,113
then you’ve got a control point, which

228
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:47,053
is here, which is fantastic

229
00:28:49,183 --> 00:28:51,283
There we go and then obviously

230
00:28:51,283 --> 00:28:53,925
you can create a lot more complex shapes

231
00:28:53,925 --> 00:28:56,533
so if you’re creating a path, it’s a

232
00:28:56,563 --> 00:29:00,043
wibbly wobbly path, you can do

233
00:29:00,043 --> 00:29:03,043
all sorts of great, great, great fun

234
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:03,703
stuff

235
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,703
This is a really good moment to

236
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,413
talk about the snap tool because this

237
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,883
makes your life an awful lot easier

238
00:29:10,093 --> 00:29:12,253
So what it’s set to by default

239
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,833
when you create a shape, let’s go

240
00:29:14,863 --> 00:29:16,423
back and get a line tool because it’ll

241
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:19,663
be probably easier, it’s snapping to the

242
00:29:19,663 --> 00:29:20,233
grid

243
00:29:21,823 --> 00:29:23,773
or it’s snapping on an intersection

244
00:29:26,023 --> 00:29:29,503
and that’s the default behavior. So it

245
00:29:29,503 --> 00:29:31,393
kind of guesses where you want

246
00:29:31,393 --> 00:29:33,523
to snap to which is great but

247
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:35,443
sometimes you say ‘I want it just

248
00:29:35,443 --> 00:29:36,784
over here’ and it’s not enough

249
00:29:36,784 --> 00:29:38,593
you want to make a free play

250
00:29:38,653 --> 00:29:41,143
sort of thing for your snapping and

251
00:29:41,143 --> 00:29:42,253
the way to do that is to

252
00:29:42,253 --> 00:29:44,563
use `Snap Free`. So if you go

253
00:29:44,563 --> 00:29:45,013
to the `Snap`

254
00:29:45,013 --> 00:29:48,253
menu and then go `Snap Free`

255
00:29:48,283 --> 00:29:51,403
or `SF` is a shortcut, then

256
00:29:51,673 --> 00:29:53,083
it’s not snapping to anything

257
00:29:53,113 --> 00:29:54,493
at all. So it means it won’t

258
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:55,933
snap onto a line. So it depends

259
00:29:55,933 --> 00:29:56,923
what you’re trying

260
00:29:56,923 --> 00:29:58,423
to achieve. I don’t know, like if you’ve

261
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:00,163
got a curvy curvy path that

262
00:30:00,163 --> 00:30:01,873
you want to make then you

263
00:30:01,873 --> 00:30:03,373
don’t really want to have it snapping

264
00:30:03,373 --> 00:30:05,173
directly to a grid or directly to another object

265
00:30:05,813 --> 00:30:07,133
Sometimes you do want it to snap

266
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:08,213
so for example if I wanted to

267
00:30:08,213 --> 00:30:09,953
close this shape, I want it to snap

268
00:30:09,953 --> 00:30:11,363
on the corner but it’s not going

269
00:30:11,363 --> 00:30:13,193
to, it’s just going to do it a

270
00:30:13,193 --> 00:30:15,653
little bit away. So `Snap Free`

271
00:30:15,683 --> 00:30:17,543
really very useful for freehand stuff

272
00:30:18,863 --> 00:30:19,823
And then the other one that you

273
00:30:19,823 --> 00:30:20,153
want

274
00:30:21,383 --> 00:30:24,263
quite commonly is `Snap On Entity`, which

275
00:30:24,263 --> 00:30:26,783
is `ST`, so get a line tool

276
00:30:26,813 --> 00:30:28,403
and I say okay, I know that

277
00:30:28,403 --> 00:30:31,553
I want to snap onto the rectangle

278
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,863
somewhere, see, it’s auto-snapping

279
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:35,363
here, you can see it’s auto-snapping

280
00:30:35,363 --> 00:30:37,253
to the middle and auto-snapping to

281
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,173
the intersection but I want it to

282
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:41,453
snap on the actual entity

283
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,523
itself, like on this circle

284
00:30:43,523 --> 00:30:46,583
for example. If I go `Snap On

285
00:30:46,613 --> 00:30:47,453
Entity`

286
00:30:48,683 --> 00:30:50,393
then it will glue itself to that

287
00:30:50,393 --> 00:30:53,183
entity. And I want to

288
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:56,243
take it off, I can go `Snap Auto`

289
00:30:57,713 --> 00:31:00,383
`Snap Auto` down here, and then it’s

290
00:31:00,383 --> 00:31:02,243
going back to automatically snapping

291
00:31:02,273 --> 00:31:03,443
to the grid or to the end

292
00:31:03,443 --> 00:31:06,082
of something else. So that’s a

293
00:31:06,082 --> 00:31:07,793
really really handy one. The final

294
00:31:07,793 --> 00:31:11,093
snap is `Snap to End`, so this is

295
00:31:11,123 --> 00:31:12,533
great if you’ve got a shape and

296
00:31:12,533 --> 00:31:13,793
you say I want to

297
00:31:13,793 --> 00:31:15,023
close this shape here

298
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:18,023
so it’s like a closed

299
00:31:18,023 --> 00:31:18,443
shape

300
00:31:19,823 --> 00:31:21,143
So what you do there, get the

301
00:31:21,143 --> 00:31:23,483
line tool and

302
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:26,389
you can click, snap, and just to

303
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:27,863
make sure it snaps on end you

304
00:31:27,863 --> 00:31:31,428
go `Snap on End`, bomf! It

305
00:31:31,428 --> 00:31:33,473
won’t snap anywhere else and you’re guaranteed

306
00:31:33,473 --> 00:31:35,843
that that shape is enclosed now. So

307
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:41,423
these snapping facilities are really really useful

308
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:42,683
it’s really handy to know

309
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:44,663
them. And it’s, yeah, just be aware

310
00:31:44,663 --> 00:31:45,891
that you’ve got the snap menu

311
00:31:45,891 --> 00:31:47,903
there and then you can use the

312
00:31:48,503 --> 00:31:50,753
snapping tools as and when you see

313
00:31:50,753 --> 00:31:52,073
fit. So when it comes up, you

314
00:31:52,073 --> 00:31:53,663
go ‘Why won’t this

315
00:31:53,693 --> 00:31:55,433
line go here?’ and you can figure out

316
00:31:55,433 --> 00:31:56,783
whether it needs to be `Snap Auto`

317
00:31:56,783 --> 00:31:58,913
or `Snap Free` or `Snap Entity` or

318
00:31:58,913 --> 00:32:00,203
`Snap to the End`

319
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:05,153
Okay, let’s get onto the entities. We’ve

320
00:32:05,153 --> 00:32:08,963
got three entities, that’s block, polyline and

321
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:11,153
text, and they're all pretty

322
00:32:11,153 --> 00:32:14,063
cool in their own special ways. A

323
00:32:14,063 --> 00:32:17,303
block is really really useful if you’re

324
00:32:17,543 --> 00:32:20,063
creating a symbol. It can be re-used

325
00:32:20,093 --> 00:32:21,383
over and over again. So for example

326
00:32:21,383 --> 00:32:23,203
you have an orchard and it’s

327
00:32:23,213 --> 00:32:24,803
got a lot of the same apple

328
00:32:24,803 --> 00:32:26,093
trees in it. You can just make

329
00:32:26,093 --> 00:32:28,913
one apple tree and then plant lots

330
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:31,163
of different instances around. When you edit

331
00:32:31,163 --> 00:32:33,353
the one block, it changes all those

332
00:32:33,353 --> 00:32:36,833
instances. But it’s also useful for creating

333
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:38,603
a shape and then applying any angle

334
00:32:39,053 --> 00:32:40,853
So in this example I’ve created a

335
00:32:40,853 --> 00:32:41,453
bench

336
00:32:41,663 --> 00:32:43,013
and I’ve then created an angle

337
00:32:43,013 --> 00:32:43,943
on it. I’ll show you how to

338
00:32:43,943 --> 00:32:45,503
do that. So hit escape to go

339
00:32:45,503 --> 00:32:48,653
back to the arrow tool, go click

340
00:32:48,653 --> 00:32:51,653
onto the shape tools and I’ll

341
00:32:51,653 --> 00:32:54,833
just create any old rectangle

342
00:32:56,543 --> 00:32:58,853
And rather than, what you can

343
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:00,683
do, if you go into the shape

344
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,353
tools and then shape with

345
00:33:03,353 --> 00:33:05,693
sizes, you can put an angle in

346
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:08,723
here but then it’s much harder once

347
00:33:08,723 --> 00:33:10,613
you’ve created that angle. Once you’ve created

348
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,653
that shape, it’s much much harder to

349
00:33:12,683 --> 00:33:15,323
edit it. So you’re better off creating

350
00:33:15,323 --> 00:33:16,066
it so that it’s

351
00:33:16,103 --> 00:33:20,273
square and *then* applying the angle afterwards

352
00:33:20,423 --> 00:33:22,343
So I’ll just show you how to

353
00:33:22,343 --> 00:33:23,933
create a block, so you select all

354
00:33:23,933 --> 00:33:24,323
those

355
00:33:25,493 --> 00:33:28,103
elements, go to the `Block` menu and

356
00:33:28,103 --> 00:33:32,543
then `Create Block From Selection` and then

357
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:33,683
you say where you want to create

358
00:33:33,683 --> 00:33:35,363
it from, sets the corner, and I’m

359
00:33:35,363 --> 00:33:37,613
going to call it, I don’t know, shed

360
00:33:38,543 --> 00:33:40,733
And down here in the `Block List`

361
00:33:40,733 --> 00:33:41,963
on the right hand side you can see

362
00:33:41,963 --> 00:33:43,193
shed comes up and then I can

363
00:33:43,193 --> 00:33:45,623
have multiple sheds

364
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:47,153
and I can put sheds down all

365
00:33:47,153 --> 00:33:50,423
over the place. Hooray. So now, for

366
00:33:50,423 --> 00:33:52,709
example, I want to edit it, I’m

367
00:33:52,709 --> 00:33:54,533
gonna say I want to

368
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,263
I don’t know, colour the lines

369
00:33:57,293 --> 00:33:59,303
make the lines a different colour, I’ll

370
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:00,773
make them green

371
00:34:03,413 --> 00:34:05,033
And then go out, and so now I’ve

372
00:34:05,033 --> 00:34:07,043
got green sheds all over the place

373
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:09,773
But if I just want to rotate

374
00:34:09,773 --> 00:34:11,993
one of my sheds, I can go

375
00:34:11,993 --> 00:34:14,513
here and I’ll just give it an

376
00:34:14,513 --> 00:34:18,203
angle in the `Properties`, it’s 45 degrees

377
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,902
type in 45 degrees and just

378
00:34:20,902 --> 00:34:22,103
that instance has

379
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:23,693
changed so that’s really kind of, yeah

380
00:34:23,753 --> 00:34:25,763
it’s really really handy and then you

381
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:26,842
can make sure that you get the

382
00:34:26,842 --> 00:34:29,362
right angle and it’s much much easier

383
00:34:29,993 --> 00:34:31,763
to control. Cool

384
00:34:33,652 --> 00:34:36,353
The other entity that I want to

385
00:34:36,353 --> 00:34:39,203
talk about was the polyline and these

386
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:40,973
are great. Best way to show you

387
00:34:40,973 --> 00:34:43,072
this is with the line tool so

388
00:34:43,342 --> 00:34:44,393
go for the line tool

389
00:34:45,743 --> 00:34:47,963
and I’ll create kind of

390
00:34:48,023 --> 00:34:51,563
linage thing, wibbly wobbly line, eeeh!

391
00:34:51,563 --> 00:34:53,393
And that’s great and you go well that’s

392
00:34:53,393 --> 00:34:54,322
fantastic

393
00:34:55,402 --> 00:34:57,053
but the pain in the bum is

394
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,493
that I have to create a shift

395
00:34:58,493 --> 00:35:01,013
click every single item before I want

396
00:35:01,013 --> 00:35:02,573
to move it or have to select

397
00:35:02,573 --> 00:35:04,643
them all by dragging it like that

398
00:35:04,943 --> 00:35:06,293
and that can be a bit painful

399
00:35:06,593 --> 00:35:07,823
So it’s much better

400
00:35:08,903 --> 00:35:10,283
or you can double-click and it

401
00:35:10,283 --> 00:35:11,813
will select the whole shape, but unless

402
00:35:11,813 --> 00:35:13,793
the shape then is touching

403
00:35:13,793 --> 00:35:15,173
something else it’ll select all that as

404
00:35:15,173 --> 00:35:18,203
well, so much much better to create

405
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:21,203
a polyline of that line. So

406
00:35:21,289 --> 00:35:23,453
create a polyline, dom-dom, double-click to

407
00:35:23,453 --> 00:35:25,433
select all of them and you go

408
00:35:25,763 --> 00:35:28,253
`Draw > Polyline >

409
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:32,693
Polyline From Selection` and I am constantly

410
00:35:32,693 --> 00:35:34,973
amazed at the number of different options

411
00:35:34,973 --> 00:35:37,223
that we’ve got but just concentrate, all

412
00:35:37,223 --> 00:35:39,353
you have to do is concentrate on

413
00:35:39,353 --> 00:35:40,763
the ones I’m giving you and

414
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,173
that to be honest these are all

415
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,033
the only ones I ever use myself

416
00:35:44,483 --> 00:35:49,193
So `Polyline From Selection`, there we go

417
00:35:49,373 --> 00:35:51,953
now, wow, look, it treats it as a

418
00:35:51,953 --> 00:35:52,973
whole kind of group

419
00:35:54,323 --> 00:35:56,123
And what it also does, if you

420
00:35:56,123 --> 00:35:57,833
click on it, it will give you

421
00:35:57,863 --> 00:36:00,023
an area, so try and work out

422
00:36:00,023 --> 00:36:01,313
what that area is

423
00:36:03,773 --> 00:36:06,443
Another handy tool, if you’ve got a

424
00:36:06,443 --> 00:36:09,293
polyline, then you want to explode it. This

425
00:36:09,353 --> 00:36:11,543
really ought to be in modifications but

426
00:36:11,543 --> 00:36:14,033
there’s a bomb here, set off that

427
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:18,503
stick of dynamite, boff! it explodes it and

428
00:36:18,863 --> 00:36:20,093
what I want to do now is

429
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,833
to close that line, so hit

430
00:36:21,845 --> 00:36:22,583
escape key

431
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,293
to go back to the arrow tool

432
00:36:24,593 --> 00:36:25,883
click on the line tool and I’m

433
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:28,433
going to close that shape and now

434
00:36:28,673 --> 00:36:31,733
you can imagine, double-click, create a

435
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:34,673
polyline from that and you can say

436
00:36:34,673 --> 00:36:38,243
yep, that is now a garden bed

437
00:36:38,423 --> 00:36:39,953
and I know that by clicking on

438
00:36:39,953 --> 00:36:41,933
it, this is about the garden bed

439
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:42,563
is

440
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:46,013
about 5 metres diameter [square!] and with a

441
00:36:46,013 --> 00:36:48,653
planting density of 5 plants per square

442
00:36:48,653 --> 00:36:51,413
metre, that’s 25 plants, thank you

443
00:36:51,413 --> 00:36:52,703
very much. So this is where it

444
00:36:52,703 --> 00:36:55,463
comes in really really useful using these

445
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:59,033
different tools. And then finally the last

446
00:36:59,693 --> 00:37:01,973
entity that I wanted to discuss is

447
00:37:02,063 --> 00:37:02,873
text tool

448
00:37:02,933 --> 00:37:04,523
And it kinda does what it says

449
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:06,353
on the tin really, enables you to

450
00:37:06,353 --> 00:37:08,453
put labels on things which is handy

451
00:37:08,453 --> 00:37:09,263
if you want to know what the

452
00:37:09,263 --> 00:37:10,823
trees are that you’re using

453
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:13,583
or what a particular structure is so

454
00:37:13,763 --> 00:37:14,363
double-click

455
00:37:15,743 --> 00:37:17,603
and then escape to go back to

456
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:20,274
the tool menu and arrow tool and

457
00:37:20,274 --> 00:37:21,683
I’m going to click on the text

458
00:37:21,683 --> 00:37:24,383
tool. Click on `Text` and it brings up

459
00:37:24,923 --> 00:37:27,173
the whole lot here. For some reason

460
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:28,973
I always colour my text orange I

461
00:37:28,973 --> 00:37:30,263
think it’s a middle

462
00:37:30,263 --> 00:37:31,853
of the road colour and fits in

463
00:37:31,853 --> 00:37:35,123
with everything else. I’m going to call this shed

464
00:37:35,573 --> 00:37:39,023
I’m gonna make it orange and think

465
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:42,983
it needs to be a bit smaller, there we go and

466
00:37:42,983 --> 00:37:44,363
you’ve got lots of options. If you

467
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:45,923
double-click on the text on

468
00:37:45,923 --> 00:37:47,243
the text itself it brings up the

469
00:37:47,243 --> 00:37:49,283
text dialog box and you’ve got lots

470
00:37:49,283 --> 00:37:51,472
of options for whether it aligns in

471
00:37:51,472 --> 00:37:53,183
the center or in the middle so that’s

472
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:55,553
all kind of handy too. There we go

473
00:37:55,793 --> 00:38:00,203
so shed, pop that there, escape from

474
00:38:00,203 --> 00:38:02,093
the block so I’m editing the block

475
00:38:02,093 --> 00:38:03,533
at the moment in the `Block List`

476
00:38:04,253 --> 00:38:05,993
click on that and then you can see

477
00:38:06,023 --> 00:38:08,303
it’s got shed at an angle, there we

478
00:38:08,303 --> 00:38:11,543
go. So those are your three entities

479
00:38:12,703 --> 00:38:14,383
What I wanted to show you

480
00:38:14,383 --> 00:38:16,903
next is very quickly is layers. Layers

481
00:38:16,933 --> 00:38:18,313
is a really really good way of

482
00:38:18,343 --> 00:38:20,953
organising different information. So you have

483
00:38:20,953 --> 00:38:23,053
one layer for areas, one layer for

484
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:25,573
structures, another layer for plants or trees

485
00:38:25,933 --> 00:38:27,373
you get the idea so you can

486
00:38:27,403 --> 00:38:29,545
organize it by different layers and

487
00:38:29,545 --> 00:38:30,733
then you can give different colors to

488
00:38:30,733 --> 00:38:32,293
each layer as well, which again helps

489
00:38:32,383 --> 00:38:34,303
with organising all the different elements

490
00:38:35,503 --> 00:38:38,233
There is on my GitHub website, you

491
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,093
can download a template so you can

492
00:38:40,093 --> 00:38:41,833
just click down here and download the

493
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:45,463
zip and then open up that file

494
00:38:46,063 --> 00:38:48,223
and it will give

495
00:38:48,223 --> 00:38:50,323
you this which is a list

496
00:38:50,323 --> 00:38:52,063
of all the layers and it’s also

497
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,133
got a handy little legend which I’ve premade

498
00:38:54,133 --> 00:38:55,513
here as well, as a block

499
00:38:56,473 --> 00:38:58,453
And I’ll be using this when I’m

500
00:38:58,483 --> 00:39:01,783
going through the different examples too

501
00:39:01,783 --> 00:39:07,123
And then finally we’ve got the mods, four

502
00:39:07,123 --> 00:39:10,183
different modifications to make. I’ll just go

503
00:39:10,183 --> 00:39:10,933
through them with you

504
00:39:12,403 --> 00:39:14,353
So here we go, mods you’ve got

505
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:16,723
four different types. Now this example is

506
00:39:16,723 --> 00:39:20,623
actually taken from a real world example

507
00:39:20,953 --> 00:39:23,983
of a gabion. Gabions are those wire

508
00:39:23,983 --> 00:39:25,813
cages with stones in. And it’s a

509
00:39:25,873 --> 00:39:29,503
gabion horseshoe shape that I’m creating for the

510
00:39:29,563 --> 00:39:31,963
local primary school. It’s like a seating

511
00:39:31,963 --> 00:39:32,263
area

512
00:39:32,323 --> 00:39:34,063
but a kind of sheltered seating area

513
00:39:34,453 --> 00:39:36,553
So I’ll just go through how

514
00:39:36,553 --> 00:39:37,633
I’ve created it

515
00:39:41,803 --> 00:39:43,243
On the center point

516
00:39:44,563 --> 00:39:47,233
I create a circle as the first thing

517
00:39:47,863 --> 00:39:49,993
and the modification tools are under this

518
00:39:49,993 --> 00:39:53,863
menu over here. Ahhh, modification tools you’ve

519
00:39:53,863 --> 00:39:57,073
already seen the the dynamite stick, so

520
00:39:57,073 --> 00:39:58,693
select the element

521
00:39:58,783 --> 00:40:00,463
that you want to modify

522
00:40:00,463 --> 00:40:03,013
and I’m going to use offset

523
00:40:03,043 --> 00:40:04,453
I think which is this one

524
00:40:04,483 --> 00:40:06,943
here `Offset (with Distance)`

525
00:40:08,113 --> 00:40:10,183
Okay it’s just 0.5 metres

526
00:40:10,183 --> 00:40:11,323
that’s how wide it is, I might make

527
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:13,813
a little bit narrower

528
00:40:13,813 --> 00:40:15,673
0.4, 0.3 metres

529
00:40:15,673 --> 00:40:16,033
say

530
00:40:17,503 --> 00:40:19,423
there we go, you get the idea

531
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,803
Yeah, 0.3 metres, 30 centimetres

532
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,493
and there we go that’s an offset

533
00:40:27,493 --> 00:40:29,473
and you can offset it either way

534
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:33,883
Okay? Now I’ll take that shape and I

535
00:40:33,883 --> 00:40:36,673
want to put two lines on to

536
00:40:36,703 --> 00:40:38,383
cut into it, so I’m going to

537
00:40:38,413 --> 00:40:40,423
draw one line on one side and a

538
00:40:40,423 --> 00:40:44,233
mirror onto the other side and

539
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:44,863
let’s do that

540
00:40:45,271 --> 00:40:48,043
Hit escape to go back, line tool, draw

541
00:40:48,043 --> 00:40:50,203
from the centre, draw out here

542
00:40:51,643 --> 00:40:53,833
Hit escape again, go back, select it with

543
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:56,413
the arrow tool, go to the modification

544
00:40:56,413 --> 00:41:00,763
tools and up here is the mirror

545
00:41:01,033 --> 00:41:02,835
and then click on mirror and say you

546
00:41:02,855 --> 00:41:06,733
want to here, that line there. And

547
00:41:06,733 --> 00:41:08,473
I want to keep the original and

548
00:41:08,473 --> 00:41:09,943
I want to just flip it over. Bomf

549
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,663
There we go, so that’s the mirror tool

550
00:41:13,663 --> 00:41:14,773
so that’s really good if you’ve got

551
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:17,683
any kind of symmetrical shapes that you

552
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,603
want to create and you can

553
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:21,883
mirror them. And now we go onto the

554
00:41:21,883 --> 00:41:24,583
divide tool, this is always a great

555
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:25,693
deal of fun so you can see

556
00:41:25,693 --> 00:41:26,923
what I’m trying to achieve here at

557
00:41:26,923 --> 00:41:30,403
the end is to cut where

558
00:41:30,403 --> 00:41:31,573
those lines intersect

559
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:34,963
So go back, hit escape key

560
00:41:35,383 --> 00:41:36,583
to go back to the arrow tool

561
00:41:36,673 --> 00:41:39,433
modification tools and then it’s the scissor

562
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:41,383
tool, which is great, nice

563
00:41:41,383 --> 00:41:45,523
and easy and for the inner circle

564
00:41:45,553 --> 00:41:47,863
click on the divide tool, the red pair of scissors

565
00:41:48,193 --> 00:41:51,733
click on the inner circle, intersection

566
00:41:51,733 --> 00:41:54,013
and intersection

567
00:41:55,363 --> 00:41:58,153
select that segment, click delete, there you

568
00:41:58,153 --> 00:42:00,883
go. And a really handy hint

569
00:42:00,943 --> 00:42:02,923
if you are doing any drawing at all

570
00:42:03,433 --> 00:42:05,413
with the line tool, rather than have

571
00:42:05,413 --> 00:42:07,993
to redraw the line, using the snap

572
00:42:08,053 --> 00:42:10,483
the automatic snap, you select the end

573
00:42:10,483 --> 00:42:12,193
of the line and it will snap automatically

574
00:42:12,403 --> 00:42:15,142
to the intersection with that circle. So

575
00:42:15,253 --> 00:42:17,863
that’s very often the kind of quickest

576
00:42:17,893 --> 00:42:21,223
way of creating the shape is to

577
00:42:21,223 --> 00:42:23,773
use your existing lines and let the

578
00:42:23,773 --> 00:42:25,693
snap do the work for you, like

579
00:42:25,693 --> 00:42:28,033
that and there we go, we’ve got horseshoe

580
00:42:28,033 --> 00:42:30,673
shape. I’ll turn that to make life

581
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,893
easier I’m going to turn this into a

582
00:42:32,923 --> 00:42:34,843
block and I’ll

583
00:42:35,533 --> 00:42:38,113
select all the items, all the elements

584
00:42:38,113 --> 00:42:42,043
in there, `Block > Create Block From Selection`

585
00:42:42,913 --> 00:42:43,963
click in the centre

586
00:42:45,343 --> 00:42:46,513
and I’m going to call that, oh

587
00:42:46,513 --> 00:42:48,133
I don’t know, horsehoe or something

588
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,612
And there we go, we’ve got a block

589
00:42:50,642 --> 00:42:53,143
and just makes that easier, creating a

590
00:42:53,173 --> 00:42:54,853
block makes it easy to rotate so that

591
00:42:54,853 --> 00:42:57,253
you can fine tune it. So select

592
00:42:57,253 --> 00:43:00,283
that, go to the `Property Editor` and

593
00:43:00,283 --> 00:43:01,843
I want to give it an angle of

594
00:43:01,903 --> 00:43:04,393
I don’t know, 45 degrees or

595
00:43:04,423 --> 00:43:06,283
56 degrees why not 56

596
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:08,323
degrees and there we go it’s an

597
00:43:08,323 --> 00:43:09,493
angle of 56 degrees

598
00:43:09,643 --> 00:43:11,533
for the horseshoe shape. So there we

599
00:43:11,533 --> 00:43:13,813
go that’s how we're using these four

600
00:43:13,813 --> 00:43:17,533
different modifications to create a horseshoe shape

601
00:43:17,593 --> 00:43:19,626
gabion wall seating area

602
00:43:19,636 --> 00:43:22,003
And finally I just want to talk to you about

603
00:43:22,003 --> 00:43:24,883
the blocks that we have our disposal

604
00:43:25,393 --> 00:43:27,493
there’s three different types of blocks that

605
00:43:27,493 --> 00:43:29,653
I’ve got, there’s forest garden plants

606
00:43:30,133 --> 00:43:32,593
again you can download these zip files

607
00:43:32,923 --> 00:43:34,723
native wild plants, this is only has

608
00:43:34,723 --> 00:43:35,893
a couple of plants in at the moment

609
00:43:35,893 --> 00:43:37,153
and this project I’m gonna be working

610
00:43:37,153 --> 00:43:38,803
on, and then garden furniture which has

611
00:43:38,803 --> 00:43:40,813
got some useful garden furniture in it

612
00:43:40,813 --> 00:43:42,553
like benches and steps and stuff like

613
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,773
that and people. So I’ll just show

614
00:43:44,773 --> 00:43:47,173
you forest garden plants first of all

615
00:43:49,903 --> 00:43:51,313
So if I click on open

616
00:43:53,473 --> 00:43:56,233
blocks, forest garden and then that’s divided

617
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,273
into five different sections and the forest

618
00:43:58,273 --> 00:44:02,503
garden plants blocks, it’s incomplete but there’s

619
00:44:02,503 --> 00:44:04,513
a spreadsheet that I have created, I’ll

620
00:44:04,513 --> 00:44:06,583
just show you the page first of all

621
00:44:08,173 --> 00:44:10,153
there’s a spreadsheet I’ve created forest garden

622
00:44:10,183 --> 00:44:14,983
bit.ly/forest-garden-spreadsheet and

623
00:44:14,983 --> 00:44:16,303
this has a list of all the

624
00:44:16,303 --> 00:44:19,003
plants in this book and I’ve started

625
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:21,343
to put all the plants into a

626
00:44:21,373 --> 00:44:24,313
block list so I was doing it anyway

627
00:44:24,313 --> 00:44:26,263
for myself but you're more than welcome

628
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:27,493
to dip in and help them

629
00:44:27,494 --> 00:44:27,973
out, help

630
00:44:28,093 --> 00:44:29,353
yourself to any of the

631
00:44:29,353 --> 00:44:30,823
trees which are in there so I

632
00:44:30,823 --> 00:44:33,883
don’t know there’s a Crataegus

633
00:44:34,003 --> 00:44:37,815
dilatata, whatever that is, click

634
00:44:37,815 --> 00:44:40,123
it out here so to

635
00:44:40,123 --> 00:44:41,623
get a block out I’ll just show you that

636
00:44:41,623 --> 00:44:44,434
again, select it from the list

637
00:44:44,563 --> 00:44:46,333
the block that you want and

638
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:48,133
then click on that icon here which

639
00:44:48,163 --> 00:44:51,043
is `Insert Block` and it gives you it out

640
00:44:51,043 --> 00:44:54,853
here. And there you go, Broadleaf Hawthorn, so

641
00:44:54,853 --> 00:44:57,643
I’ll copy that, go back to my

642
00:44:57,643 --> 00:44:58,363
mods

643
00:44:59,773 --> 00:45:01,903
paste it in, there we have a

644
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:05,017
Broadleaf Hawthorn and there’s, you’ve

645
00:45:05,017 --> 00:45:06,283
got quite a choice of quite a

646
00:45:06,283 --> 00:45:09,373
few plants there. And

647
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:14,233
then finally for garden furniture, blocks, furniture

648
00:45:14,263 --> 00:45:16,963
again you can download this. This has

649
00:45:16,963 --> 00:45:19,303
got useful things like I don’t know

650
00:45:19,603 --> 00:45:23,083
a deck chair so you can copy

651
00:45:23,113 --> 00:45:24,253
and then just copy and paste it

652
00:45:24,283 --> 00:45:25,933
in and then we’ve got a Broadleaf

653
00:45:25,963 --> 00:45:28,093
Hawthorn and a deck chair, how

654
00:45:28,093 --> 00:45:28,663
lovely is that?

655
00:45:30,193 --> 00:45:32,443
Okay thank you very much for watching

656
00:45:32,443 --> 00:45:33,763
see you in the next section which

657
00:45:33,763 --> 00:45:36,403
is about real world examples, I’ll be doing

658
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:38,923
a walk through applying all these techniques

659
00:45:38,923 --> 00:45:41,863
and using these blocks in creating two

660
00:45:41,866 --> 00:45:43,200
different types of garden, thanks
