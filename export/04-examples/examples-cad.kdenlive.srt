00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,956
Greetings and welcome, my name is Jake

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,930
Rayson, I am a wildlife and food

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,090
forest garden designer and welcome to my

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,390
online class ‘CAD for Gardeners’, this is

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,250
a beginner's guide so this is aimed

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,380
at beginners but also people who are keen

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,830
to get cracking really quickly with using

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,470
computer aided design for their garden creations

9
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,440
A couple of notes before we get started. First

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,600
of all this slideshow is always available

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,333
online natureworks.org.uk/class/cad

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,120
If you press the key `P` on

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,950
your keyboard, it brings up all the

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,050
notes and there’s some interesting links and

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,640
extra information in there as well

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,030
So without further ado let’s get cracking

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,630
An outline for today - why CAD?

18
00:00:45,632 --> 00:00:46,950
why would you bother using CAD in

19
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,720
the first place? Indeed, why would you

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,390
bother planning in the first place? And

21
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,430
then I’m going to look at setting

22
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,290
up QCAD and QCAD is the

23
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,410
software that I use for CAD designs

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,977
Going through step by step

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,800
on how to set it up so that it

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,790
all works nicely

27
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,390
The third section is looking at shapes

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,910
entities and mods. Basically the simple

29
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,100
shapes, there’s four simple shapes that if you

30
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,980
learn, you can create an infinite variety

31
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,830
of shapes by combining them, and using

32
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,060
entities to rotate stuff, and modifications to

33
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,520
alter all these different elements as well

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,000
So we’ll be

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,460
learning four basic shapes, three types of

36
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,780
entity and four modifications. And then finally

37
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,720
I’ll be looking at two examples, a

38
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,750
one acre garden and a town

39
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,880
garden and I’ll be walking through

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,700
step-by-step how to create them. So

41
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,630
why CAD?

42
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,560
A very good question! A bit of background first

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,440
of all. There is, as you might

44
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,630
well be aware, a nature and climate

45
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,990
emergency and gardens need to be a

46
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,830
wildlife haven with crops, with edible crops

47
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,570
I will give you a definition of

48
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,760
what a forest garden is because that’s my

49
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,840
gardening background

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,180
But I think in general terms

51
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,250
this world needs more gardeners and it

52
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,560
needs more gardeners who are aware of

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,810
the issues surrounding the nature and

54
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,350
the climate emergency, so changing conditions and

55
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,440
a massive, massive, massive decrease in the

56
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,720
in the number of species. This is

57
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,970
why we need all of this

58
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,570
new gardens to be planned and that’s

59
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,250
where the CAD side comes in

60
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,750
because it can make the process a

61
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,090
lot easier. So what is a forest

62
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,550
garden, I’ll just give you an overview

63
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,200
A forest garden

64
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,938
to quote Martin Crawford's fantastic book which

65
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,270
I refer to all the

66
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,310
time, Martin Crawford is a great

67
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,380
chap down in Devon and been creating

68
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,760
forest gardens for years and years and

69
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,470
years, and this is a bit of

70
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,510
a bible. It goes through a

71
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,630
whole range of different processes for setting

72
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,490
up a forest garden and all the

73
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,260
load of different species as well

74
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,660
And as he says, ‘it’s working with

75
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,480
nature to grow edible crops’ and this

76
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,210
is a photograph here from his garden

77
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,820
in Devon and what we’re doing is

78
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,240
to emulate the edge of woodland because

79
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,790
you want to have crops in the

80
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,950
understory and you want to have enough light

81
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,660
coming through. So it’s not thick dense

82
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,460
woodland, it’s the edge of woodland and

83
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,230
then you have different layers of plants

84
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,980
occupying that space. And it’s a

85
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,740
very good system because it uses

86
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,110
natural pest control and fertility, so you

87
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,420
grow all your fertility on site. So

88
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,310
essentially what you’re doing is to create

89
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,730
an edible ecosystem. What is CAD? I’m

90
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:38,880
very

91
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,010
glad you asked it is Computer Aided

92
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,050
Design. That’s a link there to the

93
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,050
Wikipedia article. Basically it’s a

94
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,230
line based drawing package; you’re creating precise

95
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,230
line diagrams and it’s used mostly in

96
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,690
architecture and manufacturing, where you need a

97
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,790
great deal of precision we don’t really

98
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,040
need that precision in gardening. It’s

99
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,500
kind of useful but that’s not the

100
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,750
the major reason for using it. If

101
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,820
you compare it to drawing programs like

102
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:10,140
Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape, the massive difference is

103
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,630
that CAD is far, far more scalable

104
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,550
and far faster. It doesn’t look as

105
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,890
pretty but it does, in my humble

106
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,810
opinion, it does the job a lot better

107
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,510
And we’re looking at 2D CAD, two

108
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,910
dimensional CAD, and this basically means that

109
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,460
it’s just in two dimensions

110
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,350
viewing it from above, and that’s a

111
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,830
plan view. I use Open Source CAD

112
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,620
a package called QCAD which I absolutely

113
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,720
love. It’s brilliant, really lovely piece

114
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,360
of software. Open Source software

115
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,820
means the code for the software is

116
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,630
freely available online and the very

117
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,810
cool thing is that the price is

118
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,460
so much cheaper than any kind of

119
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,880
commercial software. The industry standard Vectorworks costs

120
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,550
£1,230

121
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,340
per year, it’s a subscription model, and

122
00:04:59,340 --> 00:04:59,520
that

123
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,460
is just kind of outrageous and

124
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,320
to be honest, the free version of

125
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,510
QCAD is more than adequate for

126
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,210
CAD garden design. There is an alternative

127
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,100
to QCAD which is totally free called

128
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,870
LibreCAD and there’s a link in

129
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,500
the notes. I actually pay for the

130
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,960
paid version of QCAD, I paid about

131
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,680
£41

132
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,240
I think it is and the

133
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,980
reason for that really is to support

134
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,810
the developer because you have something which

135
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,940
is a good piece of software you want

136
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,770
the developer to keep on

137
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,000
working at it and to fix any

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,710
bugs and progress with it

139
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,380
There is a QCAD book as

140
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,560
well. Totally recommend getting that book, even

141
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,120
with the free version because there’s a

142
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,780
whole load of

143
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,550
information, there’s a lot of detail

144
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,840
there’s quite a stuff that you won’t

145
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,990
need but I’ll go through today showing

146
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,250
you the key points and you can

147
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,630
refer to them in the book

148
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,680
Do you even need CAD? You might

149
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,360
be better off using paper

150
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,290
if you’re only doing one design and

151
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,100
you’re not that comfortable using computers

152
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,710
5mm graph paper is

153
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,820
really good, I mean it’s a really

154
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,860
really good medium and it’s far freer

155
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,500
and in a lot of ways more flexible than

156
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,420
CAD but it’s not as easy to

157
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,440
work with if you’re working in a

158
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,480
group. This is the

159
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:15,600
5mm

160
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,680
grid that you can see there!

161
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,230
If you’re working with a group of

162
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,800
people or people who are distributed around geographically

163
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,600
you actually might be better off learning

164
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,110
CAD. Whatever you do use, get the

165
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,330
scale right. really really important to always

166
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,010
get the scale right. So that anything that

167
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,360
you add, any elements that you add

168
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,610
later on, will fit into that

169
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,530
And if you click on this image

170
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,260
it gives you a higher resolution, isn't

171
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,250
that fantastic?

172
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,570
So the CAD pros are that it’s

173
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,210
1:1 within the program itself

174
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,650
and what this means is you don’t

175
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,180
have to scale the drawing in the

176
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,910
software. If you’re creating a twenty metre

177
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,130
by twenty metre garden, you draw it as

178
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,260
twenty metres by twenty metres in the

179
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,170
software. This is as compared to using

180
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:01,920
Adobe Illustrator

181
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,142
where you have to scale

182
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,150
the drawing down, otherwise it slows the

183
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,430
program up too much. And that’s the

184
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,990
other thing about CAD as well, it’s

185
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,150
super fast. I run it on really

186
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,390
really ancient old PCs and it’s great

187
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,460
It’s just really really fast and it’s

188
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,370
accurate. It can slow down

189
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,050
if you’ve got thousands of plants on

190
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,300
there but there’s no need to worry

191
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,970
about the power of your PC. And

192
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,680
it’s easy to edit, as compared to

193
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,840
a paper plan where it can get

194
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,430
messy, and the more elements that you

195
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,630
have on a paper plan, and the

196
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,370
more you move things around the messier

197
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,500
it can get, whether you’re working with overlays

198
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,240
or whether you’re rubbing things out or

199
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,890
you’ve got little cutout bits of paper

200
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,240
to represent plants -

201
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,100
that can get a little bit

202
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,680
messy whereas you don’t have that with

203
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,800
using CAD. And it’s portable as well

204
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,880
This means that you can easily email

205
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,100
people a CAD file and you can

206
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,930
print it out as a PDF file

207
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,270
a Portable Document Format, and email that

208
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,410
to people too

209
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,620
The cons of using CAD are that it

210
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,900
is technical. I won’t lie to you

211
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,870
there is a steep learning curve to

212
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,000
it. You’ve got to put the hours

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,100
in to learn the software. But once

214
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,600
you do, and this is why it’s

215
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,950
worth it if you’re creating more than

216
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,530
one design, once you do master those

217
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,050
essential skills, then your workflow will

218
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:22,500
be much

219
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,440
quicker. And it is ugly. It’s not

220
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,230
designed to look pretty. So a nice

221
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,170
thing about Adobe Illustrator is that you

222
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,299
can create lots of shading and

223
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,470
different styles

224
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,110
But to be honest, if that’s what

225
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,250
you want to do, I would actually

226
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,350
suggest doing that within CAD and then

227
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,539
exporting that and then bringing that into

228
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,460
a different program to make it look prettier

229
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,570
Reasons to plan. In my book

230
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,000
there are five main reasons to plan

231
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,800
whether you’re using CAD or whether you’re

232
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,080
using paper. The first of these is

233
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,680
to get the spacing

234
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,960
right. In a forest garden, as

235
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,650
I mentioned before, the idea is to emulate

236
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,420
the edge of woodland, so you want

237
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,830
to have enough light coming through for

238
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,600
the understory and getting that spacing between

239
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,610
the trees is really really essential. That’s

240
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,380
like the main framework of the garden

241
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,790
design. The second reason is the position

242
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,780
and positioning of the

243
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,260
plants and positioning of the different features

244
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,440
within the garden and it’s much easier

245
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,330
with a plan to get an overview

246
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,950
of what’s going on in different parts

247
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,120
of the garden and how they relate to

248
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,600
each other

249
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,700
The third reason is quantity. CAD is absolutely

250
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,030
brilliant at calculating areas and lengths and you

251
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,830
can calc, from that you can work

252
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,740
out the quantity of plants that you require. Fourth

253
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,050
reason is communicate, so you’re communicating with

254
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,150
clients and you’re communicating with other people

255
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,550
you’re working with, whether that’s landscapers or

256
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,900
people who are putting the

257
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,140
plants out. And then finally documenting. Once

258
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,600
you’ve created your garden, it’s always

259
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,040
a good idea to know where things are

260
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,690
So tree spacing. This is an

261
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,940
illustration which has been inspired by Martin

262
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,310
Crawford’s book and this is tree spacing

263
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,880
within a forest garden. Martin Crawford

264
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,120
recommends

265
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,600
tree spacing of quarter to a half

266
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,940
of the average canopy diameter. So for

267
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,590
example you’ve got two 4 metre

268
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,990
diameter trees, then the tree spacing that

269
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,420
you want between them is 1 to

270
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,970
2 metres and that’s because you want

271
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,339
to get enough light coming through

272
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:26,970
Position

273
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,890
This is because a plan will enable

274
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,900
you to play with ideas far more

275
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,670
easily. If you’re trying to do it all

276
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,320
from memory, it could be hard to

277
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,570
remember where different things are. If you’ve

278
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,830
got a large site and you’re out

279
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,660
on site you can have great ideas

280
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,790
but it’s having somewhere to put all

281
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,120
those ideas. So it also

282
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,040
enables you, a plan, to try these

283
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,930
different positions quickly, so you can put

284
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,460
a tree in one place and then

285
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,290
put it into a totally opposite corner

286
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,660
of the garden very very quickly. And

287
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,980
it gives you an overview of the

288
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,140
different conditions within that garden, so like

289
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,570
where the water is or where the

290
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,400
light is rising and the sun

291
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:05,940
is setting

292
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,460
CAD is absolutely brilliant at working out

293
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,140
estimates, so you can figure out the

294
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,290
quantities of plants. This is a screenshot

295
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,970
from a design that I did for

296
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,900
a relatively small garden locally, and you

297
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,090
can see there’s an area here called Curve

298
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,320
it’s a kind of curved bed

299
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,270
and I can work

300
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,250
out really quickly that that’s 6

301
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,550
metres square. Likewise, there’s a line measuring

302
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,140
tool as well. And once you’ve got

303
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,370
an area and you know what your

304
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,440
planting density is, then it’s easy to

305
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,890
calculate how many plants you need. Likewise

306
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,140
if you’re planning a hedge, you know

307
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,730
how long that hedge is going to

308
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,900
be and you’ve got your planting

309
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,400
density for the

310
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,800
hedging plants then it’s again

311
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,840
very easy to calculate the quantities required

312
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,040
So, it works really really well with

313
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,450
a spreadsheet. For each of my

314
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,050
clients I create an online spreadsheet of

315
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,150
all the different plants and then I

316
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,070
can work out quantities from that and prices

317
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:05,820
from that as well

318
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,940
The fourth reason to create a plan

319
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,936
is the ability to communicate and that’s

320
00:12:14,936 --> 00:12:17,340
sharing ideas with partners, whether that’s clients

321
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,930
or other people that you’re working with

322
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,020
Really, a plan is like itself a

323
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,677
landscaping and a planting guide, so you’ve

324
00:12:25,677 --> 00:12:27,030
got any hard landscaping that you need

325
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,380
doing, any paths that need to be

326
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,960
put in or fencing, then people will

327
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,720
know the lengths and the dimensions. And

328
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,700
likewise with the planting guide, people know the

329
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,960
quantities of plants that need to be

330
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,460
put in and what densities are going

331
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,130
in at. And I always kind of

332
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,890
create online notes for each my clients

333
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,180
and then I can share a

334
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,830
PDF of the plan

335
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,200
and the original CAD file with

336
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,210
with my clients that way, so they’ll

337
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,610
see it. And a plan is fantastic

338
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,110
as a guide for your future self

339
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,790
as well, so very often you think

340
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,470
you’ll know what you’re doing with the

341
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,490
design and what you’re doing with the

342
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,100
planting but if you write it down

343
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,710
is like an aide de memoire, it really

344
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,260
really helps. So, your future self will

345
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,460
thank you if you do

346
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,000
create a plan. The fifth reason is

347
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,660
to document your planting. Where on

348
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,130
earth did you put those plants? I’m

349
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,930
sure everyone's had this before in the

350
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,510
past, you can’t remember what plant is

351
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,800
in which bed, so if you have

352
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,506
a plan, it then changes the process and

353
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,040
it becomes a document that you can

354
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,080
refer to and it tells you where

355
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,330
your plants are. And don’t forget like

356
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,740
the seasonal differences in the middle of

357
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,530
winter then all herbaceous perennials would

358
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,060
have died down so they're not going to

359
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,490
be so visible. It’s also a really

360
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,920
good document to educate the partners with

361
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,740
And management is a top priority, even

362
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,670
though it’s at the bottom of the

363
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,670
the list. I think working out how

364
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,710
a garden will be cared for and

365
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,590
managed long-term is really really important. So

366
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,150
if you’ve got a document in

367
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,830
the form of a plan that gives

368
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,180
a client something to work from

369
00:14:01,196 --> 00:14:03,086
greetings and welcome back to the second

370
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:05,216
part of my online class ‘CAD for

371
00:14:05,216 --> 00:14:07,016
Gardeners’ and here I’m going to be

372
00:14:07,016 --> 00:14:10,286
talking about setting up QCAD, now QCAD

373
00:14:10,346 --> 00:14:12,026
is my most favourite piece of CAD

374
00:14:12,026 --> 00:14:14,456
software, it’s absolutely brilliant and the free

375
00:14:14,456 --> 00:14:17,216
version is more than adequate for any

376
00:14:17,246 --> 00:14:20,426
kind of CAD garden design. It can

377
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:20,648
be a

378
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,076
little bit fiddly to be honest though

379
00:14:22,286 --> 00:14:24,296
to get the free version and to

380
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,286
get rid of the

381
00:14:25,286 --> 00:14:27,056
trial. You have to download the QCAD

382
00:14:27,086 --> 00:14:30,146
trial and there’s a few steps involved

383
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,946
in doing this. But I want

384
00:14:31,946 --> 00:14:33,566
to get this right, so that you’ve

385
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:35,396
got some reference and you’ve got

386
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:37,496
a CAD environment that you’re happy with

387
00:14:38,216 --> 00:14:40,196
So let’s get cracking with this. Press

388
00:14:40,196 --> 00:14:40,886
the `P` key

389
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,266
and it brings up the notes and, as

390
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:43,436
you can see, there’s quite a few

391
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:47,306
notes here. There are seven different steps

392
00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:52,706
and the first one is to install

393
00:14:52,736 --> 00:14:54,986
QCAD. You need to download it, go

394
00:14:54,986 --> 00:14:57,356
to QCAD.org and download

395
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:59,366
it. There’s three different versions — for Windows

396
00:14:59,396 --> 00:15:02,096
Mac and Linux — and download the appropriate

397
00:15:02,096 --> 00:15:04,166
version for your operating system and for

398
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,866
your computer. And then you need to

399
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:08,186
install it. Again

400
00:15:08,816 --> 00:15:10,346
go to QCAD.org, in the

401
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:14,456
documentation there’s an installation guide for Windows

402
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,946
Mac and Linux and, yeah, I won’t

403
00:15:16,946 --> 00:15:18,416
go into the details because that really

404
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,286
would be a bit dull

405
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:22,166
but there we have it. So, get

406
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,006
cracking with that

407
00:15:24,476 --> 00:15:26,786
Once you’ve installed it on your computer

408
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:30,446
let’s start it up. So, we’re going to

409
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:33,324
set the units to metres

410
00:15:33,324 --> 00:15:34,376
that’s going to be the first job

411
00:15:34,526 --> 00:15:37,256
So, double-click to start and then

412
00:15:37,256 --> 00:15:41,096
go to unit and metre and click

413
00:15:41,096 --> 00:15:44,246
`OK`. Now, I use metres because

414
00:15:44,246 --> 00:15:45,686
I’m in the UK and

415
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:48,716
metres are a really good unit to use

416
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:51,206
because they're approximate enough for gardening

417
00:15:51,206 --> 00:15:52,136
and they don’t have to be super

418
00:15:52,136 --> 00:15:53,966
super accurate and are not like millimetres

419
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:57,896
for architecture or micrometres for manufacturing

420
00:15:58,226 --> 00:15:59,876
So it really depends though where you

421
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,016
are in the world as to what

422
00:16:01,046 --> 00:16:03,746
units you’ll be using. But something like

423
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:04,406
metres is great

424
00:16:04,406 --> 00:16:06,416
So the first thing that we

425
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,366
need to do is to remove the

426
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:10,946
trial plugins and this is the most

427
00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:13,976
painful part and the dullest bit

428
00:16:14,186 --> 00:16:16,376
*but* it is kind of necessary. I’ve

429
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:18,446
listed them here so you

430
00:16:18,446 --> 00:16:19,976
need to find out where your plugins

431
00:16:19,976 --> 00:16:22,076
folder is and the plugins folderm

432
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:24,386
obviously it depends which operating system

433
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:24,566
you’re

434
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,366
working on. I’ll show you where

435
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:29,066
the plugins are on here

436
00:16:29,276 --> 00:16:31,196
and if we go, I know that

437
00:16:31,196 --> 00:16:33,386
QCAD on linux is installed in

438
00:16:33,386 --> 00:16:36,596
the `opt` folder, double-click on that, go in

439
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:37,466
to QCAD

440
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:40,856
and then there’s the plugins there and

441
00:16:40,856 --> 00:16:42,386
I’ll view them as a

442
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,696
list, makes it easier to delete

443
00:16:44,696 --> 00:16:46,766
them, so the list view. Basically, you want

444
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:48,896
to delete all of the

445
00:16:48,896 --> 00:16:51,776
plugins apart from these three here, so

446
00:16:51,776 --> 00:16:53,726
the easiest thing is to

447
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:56,966
select all the plugins and then deselect

448
00:16:57,086 --> 00:16:58,646
`libqcaddarkstyle`

449
00:16:58,646 --> 00:16:59,606
`libqcaddxf`

450
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:03,176
and `libqcadscripts`

451
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,896
Select all the plugins

452
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:12,356
like so, and then control-click

453
00:17:12,358 --> 00:17:15,326
`libqcaddarkstyle`, `libqcaddxf`

454
00:17:15,746 --> 00:17:18,296
and `libqcadscripts`. I’m going to

455
00:17:18,296 --> 00:17:19,976
send the rest of the stuff to

456
00:17:19,976 --> 00:17:22,856
the wastebasket. And then we go back

457
00:17:22,856 --> 00:17:25,346
into CAD and then in the widget

458
00:17:25,346 --> 00:17:27,506
on the side there’s a little button that says `Remove`

459
00:17:27,536 --> 00:17:28,165
click on `Remove`

460
00:17:28,165 --> 00:17:29,846
“To remove this add-on please

461
00:17:29,846 --> 00:17:31,586
delete the following plugins” and you go

462
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:34,616
“Yep, already done it.” The next step

463
00:17:34,646 --> 00:17:36,446
that I want to do is to

464
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:38,846
set the theme to dark and the

465
00:17:38,846 --> 00:17:41,126
background to dark grey. And the reason

466
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,856
for doing this is that I find

467
00:17:43,886 --> 00:17:46,406
an awful lot easier with the range

468
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:48,326
of standard colors in

469
00:17:48,326 --> 00:17:50,696
QCAD to work on a dark background —

470
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,406
they show up much more easily

471
00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:56,846
So go into CAD, click on `Application

472
00:17:56,846 --> 00:18:00,866
Preferences`, scroll down to `Theme`

473
00:18:02,186 --> 00:18:05,934
and then choose `Dark`. Click `OK`, it’ll

474
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:07,886
say you need to restart QCAD

475
00:18:08,006 --> 00:18:10,406
So go `OK`, quit out of

476
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:12,806
QCAD and let’s restart it. And here

477
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:14,726
we go, a nice dark theme to

478
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,006
QCAD. One last thing I want to

479
00:18:17,006 --> 00:18:18,626
do with the colours is to change the

480
00:18:18,626 --> 00:18:20,096
background because I find that black a

481
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:22,046
bit too much, a bit too intense

482
00:18:22,316 --> 00:18:24,650
a bit too doom and gloom. So

483
00:18:24,656 --> 00:18:28,256
go to `Application Preferences` and then if

484
00:18:28,256 --> 00:18:30,926
you look under `Graphics View` down here

485
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:33,596
`Colors` and then

486
00:18:34,676 --> 00:18:36,116
`Background` and I’m going to set the

487
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:38,006
background to `Others…` and I’m going to

488
00:18:38,006 --> 00:18:40,196
give it a grey color. And the

489
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:41,636
colour that I use, you can use

490
00:18:41,636 --> 00:18:43,196
whatever grey, you know, you can

491
00:18:43,196 --> 00:18:44,936
choose a colour from here, the one

492
00:18:44,936 --> 00:18:47,666
that I use as a standard is

493
00:18:47,696 --> 00:18:50,396
3e3e3e, that’s a nice

494
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,156
combination of nice calming grey. And the

495
00:18:53,156 --> 00:18:54,086
final couple of things we’re going to

496
00:18:54,086 --> 00:18:54,746
do is

497
00:18:54,806 --> 00:18:57,026
to play around with the widgets

498
00:18:57,026 --> 00:18:59,126
I want to hide the `Command Line` widget

499
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:00,986
at the bottom and then show

500
00:19:00,986 --> 00:19:02,966
the `Block List`, so if you go

501
00:19:02,966 --> 00:19:05,966
to the `View` menu and then the

502
00:19:05,996 --> 00:19:10,406
`Command Line` there, gets rid of it

503
00:19:10,406 --> 00:19:12,386
at the bottom, and then the `View`

504
00:19:12,386 --> 00:19:14,786
menu and the `Block List` and it

505
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:14,966
brings

506
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:16,016
up your `Block List`

507
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,676
And then finally, finally, what I like

508
00:19:19,676 --> 00:19:22,526
to do is to stack the `Layer`

509
00:19:22,706 --> 00:19:25,616
`Property` and `Block` widgets. So these are

510
00:19:25,616 --> 00:19:27,146
the widgets, there’s the `Layer` and the

511
00:19:27,176 --> 00:19:29,156
`Block`. I put the `Layer` on first

512
00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:31,646
and the reason for this is, this

513
00:19:31,646 --> 00:19:33,536
is the widget I use

514
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:34,826
the most, so it’s always kind of

515
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:36,386
very handy to see which layer you’re

516
00:19:36,386 --> 00:19:37,076
working on

517
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,956
And then I’ll pop in the `Property

518
00:19:39,986 --> 00:19:43,646
Editor`, the `Property Editor` widget in

519
00:19:43,646 --> 00:19:46,376
the middle, and that always has a

520
00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:48,746
lot of useful information in. And the

521
00:19:48,746 --> 00:19:50,366
one I use the least is the

522
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:52,166
`Block List`, that goes at the bottom

523
00:19:53,006 --> 00:19:54,626
And there we have it, we’re all set

524
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,216
up and ready to rock 🤘

525
00:19:56,803 --> 00:19:58,993
Greetings and welcome back to the third

526
00:19:58,993 --> 00:20:01,483
section of my online class ‘CAD for

527
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:04,273
Gardeners’ and this is shapes, entities and

528
00:20:04,273 --> 00:20:06,433
mods, you can just about see

529
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:08,473
the mods, my face is nearly covering

530
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,723
it, and here I’m going to be

531
00:20:10,723 --> 00:20:14,863
looking at four basic shapes, three entity

532
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:16,693
types and then four modifications

533
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:18,703
that you can make. And using

534
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:21,913
these tools, you can create a whole

535
00:20:21,943 --> 00:20:26,533
infinite variety of different designs, hopefully. First

536
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:28,423
of all, before going further, I wanted

537
00:20:28,423 --> 00:20:31,273
to say about finding your way

538
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,073
around QCAD because it can be a

539
00:20:33,073 --> 00:20:34,513
little bit confusing. So I’m just going

540
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:36,523
to zip over to QCAD

541
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,153
I’ll create a new file, I’m

542
00:20:40,153 --> 00:20:41,533
just going to create a circle and

543
00:20:41,647 --> 00:20:43,573
really worry too much about what I’m

544
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:44,083
doing here…

545
00:20:45,973 --> 00:20:47,803
The great thing as I said before

546
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:49,543
about QCAD is that you can

547
00:20:49,543 --> 00:20:51,673
zoom in and you can zoom out

548
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:54,433
and it can be two hundred miles

549
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:56,473
wide or it can be twenty centimetres

550
00:20:56,473 --> 00:20:59,413
wide. The QCAD doesn’t really matter

551
00:20:59,413 --> 00:21:01,003
it’s kind of 1:1 scale

552
00:21:01,003 --> 00:21:02,923
and you work at whatever size

553
00:21:02,953 --> 00:21:04,243
the thing is that you’re working on

554
00:21:05,113 --> 00:21:05,413
Erm…

555
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:08,563
so for zooming in, zooming out, there’s

556
00:21:08,563 --> 00:21:10,543
the mouse scroll. Sorry, that’s a really

557
00:21:10,543 --> 00:21:12,493
really bad pun. That is a mouse

558
00:21:12,643 --> 00:21:14,383
with a scroll, took ages to

559
00:21:14,383 --> 00:21:16,993
find that one. Mouse scroll will zoom

560
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:18,313
you in and out so the mouse

561
00:21:18,313 --> 00:21:20,593
scroll is that button there and that

562
00:21:20,803 --> 00:21:23,383
will zoom you in and out in CAD. The plus

563
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:24,973
or minus keys on your keyboard

564
00:21:26,293 --> 00:21:28,273
Snd then if you get lost, it’s

565
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:32,383
`View > Zoom > Auto Zoom` and that will

566
00:21:32,563 --> 00:21:33,853
get you back to where

567
00:21:33,853 --> 00:21:35,473
your drawing is. I’ll just show you what

568
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:36,913
I mean. So mouse scroll first of

569
00:21:36,913 --> 00:21:39,193
all, so mouse scroll, zoom in and

570
00:21:39,193 --> 00:21:40,513
you can zoom in, zoom in and

571
00:21:40,513 --> 00:21:42,823
zoom in and zoom in and and

572
00:21:42,823 --> 00:21:45,103
it’s just incredible how much you

573
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:45,733
can zoom in

574
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:48,343
until your screen is filled with

575
00:21:48,343 --> 00:21:50,803
a line. Then you can zoom out

576
00:21:50,803 --> 00:21:52,303
as well and you can zoom out

577
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:54,373
and the problem with this zooming

578
00:21:54,373 --> 00:21:55,933
in, zooming out, plus minus keys

579
00:21:57,103 --> 00:22:00,973
minus, plus… oopsie, the problem

580
00:22:00,973 --> 00:22:02,593
is, it’s actually really really easy to

581
00:22:02,593 --> 00:22:04,693
get lost and I’ve got no idea

582
00:22:04,903 --> 00:22:07,363
where my circle’s gone. So if you

583
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:11,653
go to `View` menu and then `Zoom`

584
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:15,703
and zoom auto, `Auto Zoom` which has

585
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,113
`ZA` as the

586
00:22:17,263 --> 00:22:19,573
keyboard shortcut. It’s kinda nice to use

587
00:22:19,573 --> 00:22:21,403
keyboard shortcuts because it speeds things up

588
00:22:21,403 --> 00:22:23,533
but don’t worry about it. So click

589
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:26,743
on `Auto Zoom`, wmf, it brings your

590
00:22:26,743 --> 00:22:28,933
drawing into full view. So if you’re

591
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:30,553
zooming in and zooming out, you don’t

592
00:22:30,553 --> 00:22:33,763
know where you are, click `View > Zoom >

593
00:22:34,063 --> 00:22:36,193
Auto Zoom` and it brings you straight

594
00:22:36,193 --> 00:22:37,333
back. I’ll just do it again, `View >

595
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:40,363
Zoom > Auto Zoom` it brings you

596
00:22:40,363 --> 00:22:44,833
straight back. Okay? The next

597
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:47,443
thing is panning, so with panning

598
00:22:48,643 --> 00:22:50,413
that means kind of scrubbing or

599
00:22:50,443 --> 00:22:52,873
moving across the screen

600
00:22:53,203 --> 00:22:55,123
So that’s a mouse scroll click, so

601
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,853
again the mouse scroll button and then click

602
00:22:57,853 --> 00:22:59,503
it down and then you

603
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:02,023
can pan around the document

604
00:23:02,413 --> 00:23:06,223
or `View > Zoom > Pan Zoom`, so holding

605
00:23:06,223 --> 00:23:07,573
down the mouse scroll you know

606
00:23:07,573 --> 00:23:08,773
you can

607
00:23:08,893 --> 00:23:12,373
pan across like that or `View > Zoom >

608
00:23:12,613 --> 00:23:14,803
Pan Zoom` and that enables you to

609
00:23:15,673 --> 00:23:17,113
scroll down and get really really dizzy

610
00:23:17,323 --> 00:23:19,363
So the next bit that I wanted

611
00:23:19,363 --> 00:23:21,853
to show you was what what happens

612
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:25,153
if you kind of get lost at all

613
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:28,123
The thing to remember, is don’t

614
00:23:28,123 --> 00:23:28,663
panic

615
00:23:28,963 --> 00:23:31,423
So there’s two ways that I can

616
00:23:31,423 --> 00:23:33,223
get lost. Firstly, as I said before

617
00:23:33,463 --> 00:23:37,483
is zooming and zooming out, so

618
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:40,303
that’s `View > Zoom > Auto Zoom`, so if

619
00:23:40,303 --> 00:23:41,563
I don’t know where I am and

620
00:23:41,623 --> 00:23:44,833
I can’t see anything, `ZA`, bof!

621
00:23:44,893 --> 00:23:46,873
Brings it straight back. The other thing

622
00:23:46,873 --> 00:23:49,033
is, if I’ve started clicking on different

623
00:23:49,093 --> 00:23:50,923
tools and I don’t know how to

624
00:23:50,923 --> 00:23:53,173
get back to the pointer, just hit

625
00:23:53,173 --> 00:23:55,153
the escape key and that returns you

626
00:23:55,483 --> 00:23:57,703
to the arrow tool. So, just keep

627
00:23:57,703 --> 00:23:59,443
hitting it and eventually you’ll get back

628
00:23:59,443 --> 00:24:00,853
to the pointer tool and

629
00:24:00,853 --> 00:24:02,983
then get back to square one, okay

630
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,473
So those two tools are really really useful

631
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:07,276
to get back to

632
00:24:07,276 --> 00:24:08,713
your drawing and also to get back

633
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:09,253
to your arrow

634
00:24:09,294 --> 00:24:12,343
Right, so next up is shapes

635
00:24:12,373 --> 00:24:15,313
entities and mods. As I said, four

636
00:24:15,313 --> 00:24:18,193
shapes, three entities and four mods. What

637
00:24:18,193 --> 00:24:19,663
you want to do, press the `P`

638
00:24:19,663 --> 00:24:22,483
key again, you want to download the files

639
00:24:22,513 --> 00:24:25,153
from here. This is the CAD

640
00:24:25,153 --> 00:24:27,913
gardener’s files and I’ll just show you

641
00:24:28,513 --> 00:24:29,353
where you get them from

642
00:24:29,413 --> 00:24:31,363
So this is where the files are

643
00:24:31,363 --> 00:24:34,243
stored and the files are in a

644
00:24:34,243 --> 00:24:36,703
folder called `cad-shapes-entities-mods`, probably

645
00:24:36,703 --> 00:24:38,143
the easiest thing to do is download them

646
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,673
altogether, so if you click on the

647
00:24:39,703 --> 00:24:42,583
`Code` button and then `Download zip`, unzip

648
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:43,753
it and then you’ve got the CAD

649
00:24:43,753 --> 00:24:45,133
files that you can play around with

650
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:46,513
First thing then that we’re going to

651
00:24:46,513 --> 00:24:46,843
do

652
00:24:47,983 --> 00:24:50,083
is to look at creating the four

653
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:52,663
shapes. So you’ve got a rectangle, line

654
00:24:52,693 --> 00:24:55,243
tool, circles for trees and NURBS for

655
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:59,413
curves. How terribly exciting. So rectangle is under

656
00:24:59,413 --> 00:25:01,513
the `Shape Tools` in the

657
00:25:01,513 --> 00:25:03,973
toolbar menu and the two rectangles that I

658
00:25:03,973 --> 00:25:06,103
use all the time, there’s like one

659
00:25:06,103 --> 00:25:08,053
which is just drawing a rectangle, so

660
00:25:08,143 --> 00:25:09,043
yeah, I know that it

661
00:25:10,423 --> 00:25:11,473
will be drawn like that

662
00:25:12,643 --> 00:25:14,713
Hit escape key, back for the pointer and

663
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,243
it draws a rectangle

664
00:25:16,303 --> 00:25:17,353
made out of lines

665
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:21,163
And the other one that I use

666
00:25:21,793 --> 00:25:24,733
probably a lot more, is the rectangle

667
00:25:24,763 --> 00:25:26,563
with size and this is actually really

668
00:25:26,563 --> 00:25:28,993
useful. So say I’ve got a, oh I don’t

669
00:25:28,993 --> 00:25:31,963
know, I’ve got a um shed that’s

670
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,363
3 metres by 2 metres

671
00:25:36,313 --> 00:25:37,783
I kind of just put the size

672
00:25:37,783 --> 00:25:39,103
in, along the top here

673
00:25:40,243 --> 00:25:42,223
and then there we go, it’s

674
00:25:42,253 --> 00:25:44,561
a shed which is fantastic. So

675
00:25:44,561 --> 00:25:46,963
that’s a rectangle tool. We use rectangles

676
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:49,033
mostly for structures in a garden, so

677
00:25:49,063 --> 00:25:51,583
sheds, some polytunnels and steps and

678
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:54,913
stuff like that. The next tool is

679
00:25:54,943 --> 00:25:57,553
align tool. So hit `Escape` to go

680
00:25:57,553 --> 00:26:00,043
back to the arrow tool

681
00:26:00,553 --> 00:26:02,593
click on `Line Tools` and I only ever

682
00:26:02,593 --> 00:26:04,933
use one line tool and that is

683
00:26:04,933 --> 00:26:06,823
this one here, which is `Line from

684
00:26:06,823 --> 00:26:09,313
2 Points`. And I just go… pom-ti-dom…

685
00:26:09,313 --> 00:26:12,313
create a line like

686
00:26:12,313 --> 00:26:14,953
that. And a line tools good for kind

687
00:26:14,953 --> 00:26:19,501
of irregular non-rectilinear shapes and it’s also

688
00:26:19,543 --> 00:26:20,533
really really good for

689
00:26:20,533 --> 00:26:21,583
for creating

690
00:26:23,383 --> 00:26:25,813
paths, for example, so you don’t have

691
00:26:25,813 --> 00:26:27,193
to use NURBS, you don’t have to

692
00:26:27,193 --> 00:26:28,753
create curvy paths, if you

693
00:26:28,813 --> 00:26:30,943
want to just for quickness

694
00:26:30,943 --> 00:26:33,403
you can create a basic path like

695
00:26:33,403 --> 00:26:36,313
that, yeah, so that’s the kind of

696
00:26:36,313 --> 00:26:37,393
thing that you can use it for

697
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:39,403
as well. And then creating boundaries. I’ll

698
00:26:39,403 --> 00:26:40,573
be going through all these when I

699
00:26:40,573 --> 00:26:42,073
do the examples as well, to give

700
00:26:42,073 --> 00:26:42,793
you some real world

701
00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:46,213
examples. The third shape is

702
00:26:46,243 --> 00:26:50,525
a circle and again, the circle tool, and

703
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,153
I only ever create, it’s all

704
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:54,133
these different options, it’s mind blowing

705
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:56,053
how many different options there are and what

706
00:26:56,053 --> 00:26:58,033
you can do with them and tangents

707
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,439
and all sorts of stuff, but I

708
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:01,063
only ever use one circle and that’s

709
00:27:01,063 --> 00:27:03,013
circles for trees, so you click

710
00:27:03,013 --> 00:27:03,283
there

711
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:08,113
we go, and that tool is called

712
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:10,123
let’s just make sure I’ve got the right name, `Center

713
00:27:10,183 --> 00:27:12,043
Point`, so you draw a circle from the

714
00:27:12,043 --> 00:27:14,563
point and there we go and you

715
00:27:14,563 --> 00:27:16,873
can just draw circles for trees. And this

716
00:27:16,873 --> 00:27:18,913
is where the `Property` widget comes in

717
00:27:18,943 --> 00:27:21,103
really really handy because what you can

718
00:27:21,103 --> 00:27:24,193
do, select the shape and then say

719
00:27:24,493 --> 00:27:24,613
oh

720
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:26,863
I don’t know, there’s a Sweet Chestnut

721
00:27:26,893 --> 00:27:30,673
is roughly 15 metres diameter, if you

722
00:27:30,673 --> 00:27:33,673
look in the `Property Editor` under diameter

723
00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:36,343
down here on the right hand side

724
00:27:36,733 --> 00:27:39,283
and then type in 15, there you

725
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:42,103
go, that’s the diameter of a Sweet

726
00:27:42,103 --> 00:27:44,377
Chestnut. And then I can say ‘Oh

727
00:27:44,385 --> 00:27:45,763
right then, I want to create another

728
00:27:45,763 --> 00:27:47,893
one’. And this is going to be

729
00:27:47,893 --> 00:27:50,263
4 metres wide because that’s the diameter

730
00:27:50,773 --> 00:27:53,983
Select, draw the circle, select it, diameter

731
00:27:54,103 --> 00:27:54,793
4

732
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,123
And that’s the diameter of an apple

733
00:27:58,123 --> 00:28:00,043
tree on an MM106

734
00:28:00,043 --> 00:28:03,433
rootstock, for example. So now you’ve got

735
00:28:03,523 --> 00:28:05,293
circles for trees, and then you can

736
00:28:05,293 --> 00:28:07,423
work out, using the tree spacing, you

737
00:28:07,423 --> 00:28:10,963
can calculate the distance actually it

738
00:28:10,963 --> 00:28:12,433
should be between the trees. And

739
00:28:12,433 --> 00:28:15,013
finally, NURBS. I wasn't going to show

740
00:28:15,013 --> 00:28:16,813
show you NURBS but they’re so great

741
00:28:16,813 --> 00:28:18,103
that’s such a brilliant name, it

742
00:28:18,103 --> 00:28:21,463
stands for Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines

743
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:23,503
I think. Have a play and

744
00:28:23,503 --> 00:28:24,583
if you like them and get on

745
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:26,413
with them, then use them. Again, I only

746
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,183
ever use one spline tool, this one

747
00:28:28,183 --> 00:28:30,523
at the top, spline with control points

748
00:28:31,603 --> 00:28:36,913
And you can click, click, click, double-

749
00:28:36,913 --> 00:28:39,793
click to stop the drawing, escape

750
00:28:39,853 --> 00:28:41,293
to get the arrow tool back and

751
00:28:41,293 --> 00:28:44,113
then you’ve got a control point, which

752
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:47,053
is here, which is fantastic

753
00:28:49,183 --> 00:28:51,283
There we go and then obviously

754
00:28:51,283 --> 00:28:53,925
you can create a lot more complex shapes

755
00:28:53,925 --> 00:28:56,533
so if you’re creating a path, it’s a

756
00:28:56,563 --> 00:29:00,043
wibbly wobbly path, yeah, you can do

757
00:29:00,043 --> 00:29:03,043
all sorts of great, great, great fun

758
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:03,703
stuff

759
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,703
This is a really good moment to

760
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,413
talk about the snap tool because this

761
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,883
makes your life an awful lot easier

762
00:29:10,093 --> 00:29:12,253
So what it’s set to by default

763
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,833
when you create a shape, let’s go

764
00:29:14,863 --> 00:29:16,423
back and get a line tool because it’ll

765
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:19,663
be probably easier, it’s snapping to the

766
00:29:19,663 --> 00:29:20,233
grid

767
00:29:21,823 --> 00:29:23,773
or it’s snapping on an intersection

768
00:29:26,023 --> 00:29:29,503
and that’s the default behavior. So it

769
00:29:29,503 --> 00:29:31,393
kind of guesses where you want

770
00:29:31,393 --> 00:29:33,523
to snap to which is great but

771
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:35,443
sometimes you say ‘I want it just

772
00:29:35,443 --> 00:29:36,784
over here’ and it’s not enough

773
00:29:36,784 --> 00:29:38,593
you want to make a free play

774
00:29:38,653 --> 00:29:41,143
sort of thing for your snapping and

775
00:29:41,143 --> 00:29:42,253
the way to do that is to

776
00:29:42,253 --> 00:29:44,563
use `Snap Free`. So if you go

777
00:29:44,563 --> 00:29:45,013
to the `Snap`

778
00:29:45,013 --> 00:29:48,253
menu and then go `Snap Free`

779
00:29:48,283 --> 00:29:51,403
or `SF` is a shortcut, then

780
00:29:51,673 --> 00:29:53,083
it’s not snapping to anything

781
00:29:53,113 --> 00:29:54,493
at all. So it means it won’t

782
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:55,933
snap onto a line. So it depends

783
00:29:55,933 --> 00:29:56,923
what you’re trying

784
00:29:56,923 --> 00:29:58,423
to achieve. I don’t know, like if you’ve

785
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:00,163
got a curvy curvy path that

786
00:30:00,163 --> 00:30:01,873
you want to make then you

787
00:30:01,873 --> 00:30:03,373
don’t really want to have it snapping

788
00:30:03,373 --> 00:30:05,173
directly to a grid or directly to another object

789
00:30:05,813 --> 00:30:07,133
Sometimes you do want it to snap

790
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:08,213
so for example if I wanted to

791
00:30:08,213 --> 00:30:09,953
close this shape, I want it to snap

792
00:30:09,953 --> 00:30:11,363
on the corner but it’s not going

793
00:30:11,363 --> 00:30:13,193
to, it’s just going to do it a

794
00:30:13,193 --> 00:30:15,653
little bit away. So `Snap Free`

795
00:30:15,683 --> 00:30:17,543
really very useful for freehand stuff

796
00:30:18,863 --> 00:30:19,823
And then the other one that you

797
00:30:19,823 --> 00:30:20,153
want

798
00:30:21,383 --> 00:30:24,263
quite commonly is `Snap On Entity`, which

799
00:30:24,263 --> 00:30:26,783
is `ST`, so get a line tool

800
00:30:26,813 --> 00:30:28,403
and I say okay, I know that

801
00:30:28,403 --> 00:30:31,553
I want to snap onto the rectangle

802
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,863
somewhere, see, it’s auto-snapping

803
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:35,363
here, you can see it’s auto-snapping

804
00:30:35,363 --> 00:30:37,253
to the middle and auto-snapping to

805
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,173
the intersection but I want it to

806
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:41,453
snap on the actual entity

807
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,523
itself, like on this circle

808
00:30:43,523 --> 00:30:46,583
for example. If I go `Snap On

809
00:30:46,613 --> 00:30:47,453
Entity`

810
00:30:48,683 --> 00:30:50,393
then it will glue itself to that

811
00:30:50,393 --> 00:30:53,183
entity. Yeah? And I want to

812
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:56,243
take it off, I can go `Snap Auto`

813
00:30:57,713 --> 00:31:00,383
`Snap Auto` down here, and then it’s

814
00:31:00,383 --> 00:31:02,243
going back to automatically snapping

815
00:31:02,273 --> 00:31:03,443
to the grid or to the end

816
00:31:03,443 --> 00:31:06,082
of something else. Yeah? So that’s a

817
00:31:06,082 --> 00:31:07,793
really really handy one. The final

818
00:31:07,793 --> 00:31:11,093
snap is `Snap to End`, so this is

819
00:31:11,123 --> 00:31:12,533
great if you’ve got a shape and

820
00:31:12,533 --> 00:31:13,793
you say I want to

821
00:31:13,793 --> 00:31:15,023
close this shape here

822
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:18,023
so it’s like a closed

823
00:31:18,023 --> 00:31:18,443
shape

824
00:31:19,823 --> 00:31:21,143
So what you do there, get the

825
00:31:21,143 --> 00:31:23,483
line tool and

826
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:26,389
you can click, snap, and just to

827
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:27,863
make sure it snaps on end you

828
00:31:27,863 --> 00:31:31,428
go `Snap on End`, bomf! It

829
00:31:31,428 --> 00:31:33,473
won’t snap anywhere else and you’re guaranteed

830
00:31:33,473 --> 00:31:35,843
that that shape is enclosed now. So

831
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:41,423
these snapping facilities are really really useful

832
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:42,683
it’s really handy to know

833
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:44,663
them. And it’s, yeah, just be aware

834
00:31:44,663 --> 00:31:45,891
that you’ve got the snap menu

835
00:31:45,891 --> 00:31:47,903
there and then you can use the

836
00:31:48,503 --> 00:31:50,753
snapping tools as and when you see

837
00:31:50,753 --> 00:31:52,073
fit. So when it comes up, you

838
00:31:52,073 --> 00:31:53,663
go ‘Why won’t this

839
00:31:53,693 --> 00:31:55,433
line go here?’ and you can figure out

840
00:31:55,433 --> 00:31:56,783
whether it needs to be `Snap Auto`

841
00:31:56,783 --> 00:31:58,913
or `Snap Free` or `Snap Entity` or

842
00:31:58,913 --> 00:32:00,203
`Snap to the End`

843
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:05,153
Okay, let’s get onto the entities. We’ve

844
00:32:05,153 --> 00:32:08,963
got three entities, that’s block, polyline and

845
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:11,153
text, and they're all pretty

846
00:32:11,153 --> 00:32:14,063
cool in their own special ways. A

847
00:32:14,063 --> 00:32:17,303
block is really really useful if you’re

848
00:32:17,543 --> 00:32:20,063
creating a symbol. It can be re-used

849
00:32:20,093 --> 00:32:21,383
over and over again. So for example

850
00:32:21,383 --> 00:32:23,203
you have an orchard and it’s

851
00:32:23,213 --> 00:32:24,803
got a lot of the same apple

852
00:32:24,803 --> 00:32:26,093
trees in it. You can just make

853
00:32:26,093 --> 00:32:28,913
one apple tree and then plant lots

854
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:31,163
of different instances around. When you edit

855
00:32:31,163 --> 00:32:33,353
the one block, it changes all those

856
00:32:33,353 --> 00:32:36,833
instances. But it’s also useful for creating

857
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:38,603
a shape and then applying any angle

858
00:32:39,053 --> 00:32:40,853
So in this example I’ve created a

859
00:32:40,853 --> 00:32:41,453
bench

860
00:32:41,663 --> 00:32:43,013
and I’ve then created an angle

861
00:32:43,013 --> 00:32:43,943
on it. I’ll show you how to

862
00:32:43,943 --> 00:32:45,503
do that. So hit escape to go

863
00:32:45,503 --> 00:32:48,653
back to the arrow tool, go click

864
00:32:48,653 --> 00:32:51,653
onto the shape tools and I’ll

865
00:32:51,653 --> 00:32:54,833
just create any old rectangle

866
00:32:56,543 --> 00:32:58,853
And rather than, what you can

867
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:00,683
do, if you go into the shape

868
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,353
tools and then shape with

869
00:33:03,353 --> 00:33:05,693
sizes, you can put an angle in

870
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:08,723
here but then it’s much harder once

871
00:33:08,723 --> 00:33:10,613
you’ve created that angle. Once you’ve created

872
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,653
that shape, it’s much much harder to

873
00:33:12,683 --> 00:33:15,323
edit it. So you’re better off creating

874
00:33:15,323 --> 00:33:16,066
it so that it’s

875
00:33:16,103 --> 00:33:20,273
square and *then* applying the angle afterwards

876
00:33:20,423 --> 00:33:22,343
So I’ll just show you how to

877
00:33:22,343 --> 00:33:23,933
create a block, so you select all

878
00:33:23,933 --> 00:33:24,323
those

879
00:33:25,493 --> 00:33:28,103
elements, go to the `Block` menu and

880
00:33:28,103 --> 00:33:32,543
then `Create Block From Selection` and then

881
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:33,683
you say where you want to create

882
00:33:33,683 --> 00:33:35,363
it from, sets the corner, and I’m

883
00:33:35,363 --> 00:33:37,613
going to call it, I don’t know, shed

884
00:33:38,543 --> 00:33:40,733
And down here in the `Block List`

885
00:33:40,733 --> 00:33:41,963
on the right hand side you can see

886
00:33:41,963 --> 00:33:43,193
shed comes up and then I can

887
00:33:43,193 --> 00:33:45,623
have multiple sheds

888
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:47,153
and I can put sheds down all

889
00:33:47,153 --> 00:33:50,423
over the place. Hooray. So now, for

890
00:33:50,423 --> 00:33:52,709
example, I want to edit it, I’m

891
00:33:52,709 --> 00:33:54,533
gonna say I want to

892
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,263
I don’t know, colour the lines

893
00:33:57,293 --> 00:33:59,303
make the lines a different colour, I’ll

894
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:00,773
make them green

895
00:34:03,413 --> 00:34:05,033
And then go out, and so now I’ve

896
00:34:05,033 --> 00:34:07,043
got green sheds all over the place

897
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:09,773
But if I just want to rotate

898
00:34:09,773 --> 00:34:11,993
one of my sheds, I can go

899
00:34:11,993 --> 00:34:14,513
here and I’ll just give it an

900
00:34:14,513 --> 00:34:18,203
angle in the `Properties`, it’s 45 degrees

901
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,902
type in 45 degrees and just

902
00:34:20,902 --> 00:34:22,103
that instance has

903
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:23,693
changed so that’s really kind of, yeah

904
00:34:23,753 --> 00:34:25,763
it’s really really handy and then you

905
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:26,842
can make sure that you get the

906
00:34:26,842 --> 00:34:29,362
right angle and it’s much much easier

907
00:34:29,993 --> 00:34:31,763
to control. Cool

908
00:34:33,652 --> 00:34:36,353
The other entity that I want to

909
00:34:36,353 --> 00:34:39,203
talk about was the polyline and these

910
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:40,973
are great. Best way to show you

911
00:34:40,973 --> 00:34:43,072
this is with the line tool so

912
00:34:43,342 --> 00:34:44,393
go for the line tool

913
00:34:45,743 --> 00:34:47,963
and I’ll create kind of

914
00:34:48,023 --> 00:34:51,563
linage thing, wibbly wobbly line, eeeh!

915
00:34:51,563 --> 00:34:53,393
And that’s great and you go well that’s

916
00:34:53,393 --> 00:34:54,322
fantastic

917
00:34:55,402 --> 00:34:57,053
but the pain in the bum is

918
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,493
that I have to create a shift

919
00:34:58,493 --> 00:35:01,013
click every single item before I want

920
00:35:01,013 --> 00:35:02,573
to move it or have to select

921
00:35:02,573 --> 00:35:04,643
them all by dragging it like that

922
00:35:04,943 --> 00:35:06,293
and that can be a bit painful

923
00:35:06,593 --> 00:35:07,823
So it’s much better

924
00:35:08,903 --> 00:35:10,283
or you can double-click and it

925
00:35:10,283 --> 00:35:11,813
will select the whole shape, but unless

926
00:35:11,813 --> 00:35:13,793
the shape then is touching

927
00:35:13,793 --> 00:35:15,173
something else it’ll select all that as

928
00:35:15,173 --> 00:35:18,203
well, so much much better to create

929
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:21,203
a polyline of that line. So

930
00:35:21,289 --> 00:35:23,453
create a polyline, dom-dom, double-click to

931
00:35:23,453 --> 00:35:25,433
select all of them and you go

932
00:35:25,763 --> 00:35:28,253
`Draw > Polyline >

933
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:32,693
Polyline From Selection` and I am constantly

934
00:35:32,693 --> 00:35:34,973
amazed at the number of different options

935
00:35:34,973 --> 00:35:37,223
that we’ve got but just concentrate, all

936
00:35:37,223 --> 00:35:39,353
you have to do is concentrate on

937
00:35:39,353 --> 00:35:40,763
the ones I’m giving you and

938
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,173
that to be honest these are all

939
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,033
the only ones I ever use myself

940
00:35:44,483 --> 00:35:49,193
So `Polyline From Selection`, there we go

941
00:35:49,373 --> 00:35:51,953
now, wow, look, it treats it as a

942
00:35:51,953 --> 00:35:52,973
whole kind of group

943
00:35:54,323 --> 00:35:56,123
And what it also does, if you

944
00:35:56,123 --> 00:35:57,833
click on it, it will give you

945
00:35:57,863 --> 00:36:00,023
an area, so try and work out

946
00:36:00,023 --> 00:36:01,313
what that area is

947
00:36:03,773 --> 00:36:06,443
Another handy tool, if you’ve got a

948
00:36:06,443 --> 00:36:09,293
polyline, then you want to explode it. This

949
00:36:09,353 --> 00:36:11,543
really ought to be in modifications but

950
00:36:11,543 --> 00:36:14,033
there’s a bomb here, set off that

951
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:18,503
stick of dynamite, boff! it explodes it and

952
00:36:18,863 --> 00:36:20,093
what I want to do now is

953
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,833
to close that line, so hit

954
00:36:21,845 --> 00:36:22,583
escape key

955
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,293
to go back to the arrow tool

956
00:36:24,593 --> 00:36:25,883
click on the line tool and I’m

957
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:28,433
going to close that shape and now

958
00:36:28,673 --> 00:36:31,733
you can imagine, double-click, create a

959
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:34,673
polyline from that and you can say

960
00:36:34,673 --> 00:36:38,243
yep, that is now a garden bed

961
00:36:38,423 --> 00:36:39,953
and I know that by clicking on

962
00:36:39,953 --> 00:36:41,933
it, this is about the garden bed

963
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:42,563
is

964
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:46,013
about 5 metres diameter [square!] and with a

965
00:36:46,013 --> 00:36:48,653
planting density of 5 plants per square

966
00:36:48,653 --> 00:36:51,413
metre, that’s 25 plants, thank you

967
00:36:51,413 --> 00:36:52,703
very much. So this is where it

968
00:36:52,703 --> 00:36:55,463
comes in really really useful using these

969
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:59,033
different tools. And then finally the last

970
00:36:59,693 --> 00:37:01,973
entity that I wanted to discuss is

971
00:37:02,063 --> 00:37:02,873
text tool

972
00:37:02,933 --> 00:37:04,523
And it kinda does what it says

973
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:06,353
on the tin really, enables you to

974
00:37:06,353 --> 00:37:08,453
put labels on things which is handy

975
00:37:08,453 --> 00:37:09,263
if you want to know what the

976
00:37:09,263 --> 00:37:10,823
trees are that you’re using

977
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:13,583
or what a particular structure is so

978
00:37:13,763 --> 00:37:14,363
double-click

979
00:37:15,743 --> 00:37:17,603
and then escape to go back to

980
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:20,274
the tool menu and arrow tool and

981
00:37:20,274 --> 00:37:21,683
I’m going to click on the text

982
00:37:21,683 --> 00:37:24,383
tool. Click on `Text` and it brings up

983
00:37:24,923 --> 00:37:27,173
the whole lot here. For some reason

984
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:28,973
I always colour my text orange I

985
00:37:28,973 --> 00:37:30,263
think it’s a middle

986
00:37:30,263 --> 00:37:31,853
of the road colour and fits in

987
00:37:31,853 --> 00:37:35,123
with everything else. I’m going to call this shed

988
00:37:35,573 --> 00:37:39,023
I’m gonna make it orange and think

989
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:42,983
it needs to be a bit smaller, there we go and

990
00:37:42,983 --> 00:37:44,363
you’ve got lots of options. If you

991
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:45,923
double-click on the text on

992
00:37:45,923 --> 00:37:47,243
the text itself it brings up the

993
00:37:47,243 --> 00:37:49,283
text dialog box and you’ve got lots

994
00:37:49,283 --> 00:37:51,472
of options for whether it aligns in

995
00:37:51,472 --> 00:37:53,183
the center or in the middle so that’s

996
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:55,553
all kind of handy too. There we go

997
00:37:55,793 --> 00:38:00,203
so shed, pop that there, escape from

998
00:38:00,203 --> 00:38:02,093
the block so I’m editing the block

999
00:38:02,093 --> 00:38:03,533
at the moment in the `Block List`

1000
00:38:04,253 --> 00:38:05,993
click on that and then you can see

1001
00:38:06,023 --> 00:38:08,303
it’s got shed at an angle, there we

1002
00:38:08,303 --> 00:38:11,543
go. So those are your three entities

1003
00:38:12,703 --> 00:38:14,383
What I wanted to show you

1004
00:38:14,383 --> 00:38:16,903
next is very quickly is layers. Layers

1005
00:38:16,933 --> 00:38:18,313
is a really really good way of

1006
00:38:18,343 --> 00:38:20,953
organising different information. So you have

1007
00:38:20,953 --> 00:38:23,053
one layer for areas, one layer for

1008
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:25,573
structures, another layer for plants or trees

1009
00:38:25,933 --> 00:38:27,373
you get the idea so you can

1010
00:38:27,403 --> 00:38:29,545
organize it by different layers and

1011
00:38:29,545 --> 00:38:30,733
then you can give different colors to

1012
00:38:30,733 --> 00:38:32,293
each layer as well, which again helps

1013
00:38:32,383 --> 00:38:34,303
with organising all the different elements

1014
00:38:35,503 --> 00:38:38,233
There is on my GitHub website, you

1015
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,093
can download a template so you can

1016
00:38:40,093 --> 00:38:41,833
just click down here and download the

1017
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:45,463
zip and then open up that file

1018
00:38:46,063 --> 00:38:48,223
and it will give

1019
00:38:48,223 --> 00:38:50,323
you this which is a list

1020
00:38:50,323 --> 00:38:52,063
of all the layers and it’s also

1021
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,133
got a handy little legend which I’ve premade

1022
00:38:54,133 --> 00:38:55,513
here as well, as a block

1023
00:38:56,473 --> 00:38:58,453
And I’ll be using this when I’m

1024
00:38:58,483 --> 00:39:01,783
going through the different examples too

1025
00:39:01,783 --> 00:39:07,123
And then finally we’ve got the mods, four

1026
00:39:07,123 --> 00:39:10,183
different modifications to make. I’ll just go

1027
00:39:10,183 --> 00:39:10,933
through them with you

1028
00:39:12,403 --> 00:39:14,353
So here we go, mods you’ve got

1029
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:16,723
four different types. Now this example is

1030
00:39:16,723 --> 00:39:20,623
actually taken from a real world example

1031
00:39:20,953 --> 00:39:23,983
of a gabion. Gabions are those wire

1032
00:39:23,983 --> 00:39:25,813
cages with stones in. And it’s a

1033
00:39:25,873 --> 00:39:29,503
gabion horseshoe shape that I’m creating for the

1034
00:39:29,563 --> 00:39:31,963
local primary school. It’s like a seating

1035
00:39:31,963 --> 00:39:32,263
area

1036
00:39:32,323 --> 00:39:34,063
but a kind of sheltered seating area

1037
00:39:34,453 --> 00:39:36,553
So I’ll just go through how

1038
00:39:36,553 --> 00:39:37,633
I’ve created it

1039
00:39:41,803 --> 00:39:43,243
On the center point

1040
00:39:44,563 --> 00:39:47,233
I create a circle as the first thing

1041
00:39:47,863 --> 00:39:49,993
and the modification tools are under this

1042
00:39:49,993 --> 00:39:53,863
menu over here. Ahhh, modification tools you’ve

1043
00:39:53,863 --> 00:39:57,073
already seen the the dynamite stick, so

1044
00:39:57,073 --> 00:39:58,693
select the element

1045
00:39:58,783 --> 00:40:00,463
that you want to modify

1046
00:40:00,463 --> 00:40:03,013
and I’m going to use offset

1047
00:40:03,043 --> 00:40:04,453
I think which is this one

1048
00:40:04,483 --> 00:40:06,943
here `Offset (with Distance)`

1049
00:40:08,113 --> 00:40:10,183
Okay it’s just 0.5 metres

1050
00:40:10,183 --> 00:40:11,323
that’s how wide it is, I might make

1051
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:13,813
a little bit narrower

1052
00:40:13,813 --> 00:40:15,673
0.4, 0.3 metres

1053
00:40:15,673 --> 00:40:16,033
say

1054
00:40:17,503 --> 00:40:19,423
there we go, you get the idea

1055
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,803
Yeah, 0.3 metres, 30 centimetres

1056
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,493
and there we go that’s an offset

1057
00:40:27,493 --> 00:40:29,473
and you can offset it either way

1058
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:33,883
Okay? Now I’ll take that shape and I

1059
00:40:33,883 --> 00:40:36,673
want to put two lines on to

1060
00:40:36,703 --> 00:40:38,383
cut into it, so I’m going to

1061
00:40:38,413 --> 00:40:40,423
draw one line on one side and a

1062
00:40:40,423 --> 00:40:44,233
mirror onto the other side and yeah

1063
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:44,863
let’s do that

1064
00:40:45,271 --> 00:40:48,043
Hit escape to go back, line tool, draw

1065
00:40:48,043 --> 00:40:50,203
from the centre, draw out here

1066
00:40:51,643 --> 00:40:53,833
Hit escape again, go back, select it with

1067
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:56,413
the arrow tool, go to the modification

1068
00:40:56,413 --> 00:41:00,763
tools and up here is the mirror

1069
00:41:01,033 --> 00:41:02,835
and then click on mirror and say you

1070
00:41:02,855 --> 00:41:06,733
want to here, that line there. And

1071
00:41:06,733 --> 00:41:08,473
I want to keep the original and

1072
00:41:08,473 --> 00:41:09,943
I want to just flip it over. Bomf

1073
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,663
There we go, so that’s the mirror tool

1074
00:41:13,663 --> 00:41:14,773
so that’s really good if you’ve got

1075
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:17,683
any kind of symmetrical shapes that you

1076
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,603
want to create and you can

1077
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:21,883
mirror them. And now we go onto the

1078
00:41:21,883 --> 00:41:24,583
divide tool, this is always a great

1079
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:25,693
deal of fun so you can see

1080
00:41:25,693 --> 00:41:26,923
what I’m trying to achieve here at

1081
00:41:26,923 --> 00:41:30,403
the end is to cut where

1082
00:41:30,403 --> 00:41:31,573
those lines intersect

1083
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:34,963
So go back, hit escape key

1084
00:41:35,383 --> 00:41:36,583
to go back to the arrow tool

1085
00:41:36,673 --> 00:41:39,433
modification tools and then it’s the scissor

1086
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:41,383
tool, which is great, nice

1087
00:41:41,383 --> 00:41:45,523
and easy and for the inner circle

1088
00:41:45,553 --> 00:41:47,863
click on the divide tool, the red pair of scissors

1089
00:41:48,193 --> 00:41:51,733
click on the inner circle, intersection

1090
00:41:51,733 --> 00:41:54,013
and intersection

1091
00:41:55,363 --> 00:41:58,153
select that segment, click delete, there you

1092
00:41:58,153 --> 00:42:00,883
go. And a really handy hint

1093
00:42:00,943 --> 00:42:02,923
if you are doing any drawing at all

1094
00:42:03,433 --> 00:42:05,413
with the line tool, rather than have

1095
00:42:05,413 --> 00:42:07,993
to redraw the line, using the snap

1096
00:42:08,053 --> 00:42:10,483
the automatic snap, you select the end

1097
00:42:10,483 --> 00:42:12,193
of the line and it will snap automatically

1098
00:42:12,403 --> 00:42:15,142
to the intersection with that circle. So

1099
00:42:15,253 --> 00:42:17,863
that’s very often the kind of quickest

1100
00:42:17,893 --> 00:42:21,223
way of creating the shape is to

1101
00:42:21,223 --> 00:42:23,773
use your existing lines and let the

1102
00:42:23,773 --> 00:42:25,693
snap do the work for you, like

1103
00:42:25,693 --> 00:42:28,033
that and there we go, we’ve got horseshoe

1104
00:42:28,033 --> 00:42:30,673
shape. I’ll turn that to make life

1105
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,893
easier I’m gonna turn this into a

1106
00:42:32,923 --> 00:42:34,843
block and I’ll

1107
00:42:35,533 --> 00:42:38,113
select all the items, all the elements

1108
00:42:38,113 --> 00:42:42,043
in there, `Block > Create Block From Selection`

1109
00:42:42,913 --> 00:42:43,963
click in the centre

1110
00:42:45,343 --> 00:42:46,513
and I’m going to call that, oh

1111
00:42:46,513 --> 00:42:48,133
I don’t know, horsehoe or something

1112
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,612
And there we go, we’ve got a block

1113
00:42:50,642 --> 00:42:53,143
and just makes that easier, creating a

1114
00:42:53,173 --> 00:42:54,853
block makes it easy to rotate so that

1115
00:42:54,853 --> 00:42:57,253
you can fine tune it. So select

1116
00:42:57,253 --> 00:43:00,283
that, go to the `Property Editor` and

1117
00:43:00,283 --> 00:43:01,843
I want to give it an angle of

1118
00:43:01,903 --> 00:43:04,393
I don’t know, 45 degrees or

1119
00:43:04,423 --> 00:43:06,283
56 degrees why not 56

1120
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:08,323
degrees and there we go it’s an

1121
00:43:08,323 --> 00:43:09,493
angle of 56 degrees

1122
00:43:09,643 --> 00:43:11,533
for the horseshoe shape. So there we

1123
00:43:11,533 --> 00:43:13,813
go that’s how we're using these four

1124
00:43:13,813 --> 00:43:17,533
different modifications to create a horseshoe shape

1125
00:43:17,593 --> 00:43:21,013
gabion wall seating area. And finally I

1126
00:43:21,043 --> 00:43:22,003
just want to talk to you about

1127
00:43:22,003 --> 00:43:24,883
the blocks that we have our disposal

1128
00:43:25,393 --> 00:43:27,493
there’s three different types of blocks that

1129
00:43:27,493 --> 00:43:29,653
I’ve got, there’s forest garden plants

1130
00:43:30,133 --> 00:43:32,593
again you can download these zip files

1131
00:43:32,923 --> 00:43:34,723
native wild plants, this is only has

1132
00:43:34,723 --> 00:43:35,893
a couple of plants in at the moment

1133
00:43:35,893 --> 00:43:37,153
and this project I’m gonna be working

1134
00:43:37,153 --> 00:43:38,803
on, and then garden furniture which has

1135
00:43:38,803 --> 00:43:40,813
got some useful garden furniture in it

1136
00:43:40,813 --> 00:43:42,553
like benches and steps and stuff like

1137
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,773
that and people. So I’ll just show

1138
00:43:44,773 --> 00:43:47,173
you forest garden plants first of all

1139
00:43:49,903 --> 00:43:51,313
So if I click on open

1140
00:43:53,473 --> 00:43:56,233
blocks, forest garden and then that’s divided

1141
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,273
into five different sections and the forest

1142
00:43:58,273 --> 00:44:02,503
garden plants blocks, it’s incomplete but there’s

1143
00:44:02,503 --> 00:44:04,513
a spreadsheet that I have created, I’ll

1144
00:44:04,513 --> 00:44:06,583
just show you the page first of all

1145
00:44:08,173 --> 00:44:10,153
there’s a spreadsheet I’ve created forest garden

1146
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:12,516
bit.ly/forest-garden-spreadsheet

1147
00:44:12,538 --> 00:44:14,983
bit.ly/forest-garden-spreadsheet and

1148
00:44:14,983 --> 00:44:16,303
this has a list of all the

1149
00:44:16,303 --> 00:44:19,003
plants in this book and I’ve started

1150
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:21,343
to put all the plants into a

1151
00:44:21,373 --> 00:44:24,313
block list so I was doing it anyway

1152
00:44:24,313 --> 00:44:26,263
for myself but you're more than welcome

1153
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:27,493
to dip in and and help them

1154
00:44:27,494 --> 00:44:27,973
out, help

1155
00:44:28,093 --> 00:44:29,353
yourself to any of the

1156
00:44:29,353 --> 00:44:30,823
trees which are in there so I

1157
00:44:30,823 --> 00:44:33,883
don’t know there’s a Crataegus

1158
00:44:34,003 --> 00:44:37,815
dilatata, whatever that is, click

1159
00:44:37,815 --> 00:44:40,123
it out here so to, yep, to

1160
00:44:40,123 --> 00:44:41,623
get a block out I’ll just show you that

1161
00:44:41,623 --> 00:44:44,434
again, select it from the list

1162
00:44:44,563 --> 00:44:46,333
the block that you want and

1163
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:48,133
then click on that icon here which

1164
00:44:48,163 --> 00:44:51,043
is `Insert Block` and it gives you it out

1165
00:44:51,043 --> 00:44:54,853
here. And there you go, Broadleaf Hawthorn, so

1166
00:44:54,853 --> 00:44:57,643
I’ll copy that, go back to my

1167
00:44:57,643 --> 00:44:58,363
mods

1168
00:44:59,773 --> 00:45:01,903
paste it in, there we have a

1169
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:05,017
Broadleaf Hawthorn and there’s, yeah, you’ve

1170
00:45:05,017 --> 00:45:06,283
got quite a choice of quite a

1171
00:45:06,283 --> 00:45:09,373
few plants there. And

1172
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:14,233
then finally for garden furniture, blocks, furniture

1173
00:45:14,263 --> 00:45:16,963
again you can download this. This has

1174
00:45:16,963 --> 00:45:19,303
got useful things like I don’t know

1175
00:45:19,603 --> 00:45:23,083
a deck chair so you can copy

1176
00:45:23,113 --> 00:45:24,253
and then just copy and paste it

1177
00:45:24,283 --> 00:45:25,933
in and then we’ve got a Broadleaf

1178
00:45:25,963 --> 00:45:28,093
Hawthorn and a deck chair, how

1179
00:45:28,093 --> 00:45:28,663
lovely is that?

1180
00:45:30,193 --> 00:45:32,443
Okay thank you very much for watching

1181
00:45:32,443 --> 00:45:33,763
see you in the next section which

1182
00:45:33,763 --> 00:45:36,403
is about real world examples, I’ll be doing

1183
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:38,923
a walk through applying all these techniques

1184
00:45:38,923 --> 00:45:41,863
and using these blocks in creating two

1185
00:45:41,863 --> 00:45:44,443
different types of garden, thanks

1186
00:45:44,443 --> 00:45:46,663
Greetings and welcome to section four of my online

1187
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:49,423
class ‘CAD for Gardeners’ and here I’m

1188
00:45:49,453 --> 00:45:50,053
going be looking at

1189
00:45:50,053 --> 00:45:52,753
a couple of real world examples. First

1190
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:54,313
of all I’m looking at an

1191
00:45:54,403 --> 00:45:56,773
average sized garden in the UK

1192
00:45:57,223 --> 00:45:58,813
so that you can get an idea

1193
00:45:58,813 --> 00:46:00,643
of scale and how that compares to

1194
00:46:00,763 --> 00:46:03,673
compares with an acre which is a

1195
00:46:03,703 --> 00:46:06,493
traditional UK area of land

1196
00:46:07,393 --> 00:46:08,743
Then I’ll be looking at using a

1197
00:46:08,743 --> 00:46:10,213
satellite photograph

1198
00:46:10,213 --> 00:46:12,793
a screenshot of a satellite photograph

1199
00:46:12,893 --> 00:46:15,383
as a background for a CAD

1200
00:46:15,383 --> 00:46:18,623
plan which works better with the larger

1201
00:46:18,653 --> 00:46:20,993
garden and then the actual

1202
00:46:20,993 --> 00:46:23,573
gardens themselves and these are real clients

1203
00:46:23,603 --> 00:46:26,003
that I’ve had, ones about an acre for

1204
00:46:26,003 --> 00:46:27,683
the garden and ones a town

1205
00:46:27,683 --> 00:46:30,850
garden. So the average garden in the

1206
00:46:30,863 --> 00:46:32,693
UK is a 188

1207
00:46:32,783 --> 00:46:32,993
square

1208
00:46:32,993 --> 00:46:35,873
metres apparently, according to the Office of

1209
00:46:35,873 --> 00:46:39,233
National Statistics. In london that’s 140

1210
00:46:39,233 --> 00:46:42,233
140 square metres and that compares

1211
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:44,303
to an acre which is 4,000

1212
00:46:44,303 --> 00:46:45,833
4,000 square metres and you can see here

1213
00:46:46,163 --> 00:46:49,313
in this image that there is the

1214
00:46:49,313 --> 00:46:50,513
one acre, the one on the left-hand

1215
00:46:50,513 --> 00:46:51,773
side and then this garden on the

1216
00:46:51,773 --> 00:46:53,093
right-hand side. Should be able to

1217
00:46:53,153 --> 00:46:54,593
yeah, this is a screenshot that

1218
00:46:54,593 --> 00:46:56,123
I did so you can just see

1219
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:59,093
how they compare and forest

1220
00:46:59,093 --> 00:47:02,933
gardens do tend to be a

1221
00:47:02,933 --> 00:47:04,493
bit larger than your

1222
00:47:04,493 --> 00:47:07,373
average garden, mostly because they have

1223
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:09,083
more trees and more people

1224
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:10,973
think about them in

1225
00:47:10,973 --> 00:47:12,563
that way but you can have a

1226
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:13,313
forest garden

1227
00:47:13,343 --> 00:47:15,473
in a small garden, it’s much more

1228
00:47:15,623 --> 00:47:18,563
about the process and the principles than

1229
00:47:18,563 --> 00:47:20,483
it is about the actual size

1230
00:47:20,483 --> 00:47:23,333
of the garden. So now looking at

1231
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:25,253
a satellite photograph this is a

1232
00:47:25,253 --> 00:47:26,393
3D version but we're going to use

1233
00:47:26,393 --> 00:47:29,003
the 2D plan. There’s three steps

1234
00:47:29,003 --> 00:47:32,303
to using a satellite photograph as a

1235
00:47:32,306 --> 00:47:33,473
background for

1236
00:47:33,473 --> 00:47:35,723
your CAD plan. First one is to take

1237
00:47:35,723 --> 00:47:38,873
a screenshot, then we work out the

1238
00:47:38,873 --> 00:47:41,303
metres per pixel and then we import

1239
00:47:41,303 --> 00:47:43,943
that image into QCAD. I’ll just quickly go

1240
00:47:43,943 --> 00:47:45,533
through that process now and I’ll be

1241
00:47:45,533 --> 00:47:47,933
going through this again later for

1242
00:47:47,933 --> 00:47:50,093
both examples. First I’ll take a

1243
00:47:50,093 --> 00:47:51,893
screenshot. Make sure it’s the highest resolution

1244
00:47:51,893 --> 00:47:53,483
possible and

1245
00:47:53,633 --> 00:47:56,753
then be sure to include the

1246
00:47:56,753 --> 00:47:58,973
scale in metres, you can just about

1247
00:47:58,973 --> 00:48:00,773
see that down in the bottom right-hand corner

1248
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:03,053
and save it as a good quality

1249
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:07,973
JPEG. Then you measure the pixel length

1250
00:48:08,003 --> 00:48:10,793
of the metres scale, so zooming in

1251
00:48:10,793 --> 00:48:13,643
here, that’s 5 metres that scale at

1252
00:48:13,643 --> 00:48:13,733
the

1253
00:48:13,793 --> 00:48:15,323
bottom and you can see it’s

1254
00:48:15,323 --> 00:48:17,813
106 pixels, so metres

1255
00:48:17,813 --> 00:48:20,243
per pixel, 5 metres divided by

1256
00:48:20,243 --> 00:48:22,522
106 pixels gives you

1257
00:48:22,522 --> 00:48:24,593
0.047 blah de blah de blah

1258
00:48:25,084 --> 00:48:27,683
metres per pixel and that is your

1259
00:48:27,983 --> 00:48:29,723
call it image scale factor, that’s how

1260
00:48:29,723 --> 00:48:31,313
much you need to scale the image down

1261
00:48:31,673 --> 00:48:33,953
because when you import an image

1262
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:36,953
image into QCAD, it imports it at

1263
00:48:36,953 --> 00:48:39,503
1 metre per pixel whereas actually we’ve

1264
00:48:39,503 --> 00:48:42,203
got 0.047 metres per

1265
00:48:42,203 --> 00:48:44,693
pixel here. So that’s the reason for

1266
00:48:44,693 --> 00:48:46,463
scaling it and it’s really really important to

1267
00:48:46,463 --> 00:48:48,023
do that otherwise all your

1268
00:48:48,233 --> 00:48:49,193
measurements will be out

1269
00:48:50,873 --> 00:48:52,583
And then we go into QCAD

1270
00:48:52,613 --> 00:48:55,403
`File > Import > Select > Select All`

1271
00:48:56,843 --> 00:48:59,033
View the `Property Editor`, so that’s

1272
00:48:59,033 --> 00:49:00,173
under the `File` menu and this is

1273
00:49:00,173 --> 00:49:02,153
where you're bringing in the image, view

1274
00:49:02,153 --> 00:49:03,233
the `Property Editor`

1275
00:49:04,793 --> 00:49:06,113
which I’ve actually got locked now on the

1276
00:49:06,113 --> 00:49:09,533
right-hand side and you want to put

1277
00:49:09,533 --> 00:49:11,153
in the width and the height factor

1278
00:49:11,153 --> 00:49:13,253
you can just see down there, there’s

1279
00:49:13,253 --> 00:49:14,753
a width factor for the

1280
00:49:14,753 --> 00:49:16,673
image and the height factor and

1281
00:49:16,733 --> 00:49:20,090
in there we enter that number

1282
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,803
0.047 that’s a metre

1283
00:49:21,807 --> 00:49:23,903
that’s the image scale factor that’s metres

1284
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,593
per pixel

1285
00:49:24,593 --> 00:49:27,353
Yep. So enter them in there

1286
00:49:27,803 --> 00:49:29,213
and then that image gets scaled down

1287
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:33,203
Cool, so that’s quite straightforward steps but

1288
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:36,143
can be really really useful having that

1289
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:38,753
satellite photograph in a CAD plan because

1290
00:49:38,753 --> 00:49:41,543
it’s really handy guide to have. Obviously

1291
00:49:41,873 --> 00:49:43,583
you want to be, you’ve got got to

1292
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:44,753
be aware of there’s copyright issues

1293
00:49:44,783 --> 00:49:47,153
you can't use this commercially etc etc

1294
00:49:47,243 --> 00:49:49,823
but it’s handy to know how

1295
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,533
to do it. Okay so I’m going

1296
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:54,353
to jump straight over into creating the

1297
00:49:54,383 --> 00:49:58,943
garden acre example. Jump over into QCAD

1298
00:49:59,377 --> 00:50:01,313
I’ll quickly show you how to add a

1299
00:50:01,313 --> 00:50:03,375
template so the first thing that we

1300
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:04,283
need to do is to go to

1301
00:50:04,283 --> 00:50:04,913
my GitHub

1302
00:50:04,973 --> 00:50:07,643
page github.com/growdigital/template

1303
00:50:07,643 --> 00:50:11,333
and download that

1304
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:15,023
template, so click on `Code`, `Download ZIP`. Once

1305
00:50:15,023 --> 00:50:17,393
that has finished downloading go to your

1306
00:50:17,423 --> 00:50:18,653
download folder

1307
00:50:20,093 --> 00:50:21,263
and unzip it

1308
00:50:22,433 --> 00:50:24,953
unzip it there, I’m going to rename it

1309
00:50:24,983 --> 00:50:27,473
template just to keep things tidy

1310
00:50:28,673 --> 00:50:31,733
Going to cut that and I have created

1311
00:50:31,793 --> 00:50:34,223
in my documents folder I have

1312
00:50:34,223 --> 00:50:36,713
created a QCAD folder and that’s

1313
00:50:36,713 --> 00:50:39,083
where I’m gonna put my templates so

1314
00:50:39,173 --> 00:50:41,843
paste that in there. Now I need

1315
00:50:41,843 --> 00:50:43,313
to go back into QCAD

1316
00:50:45,173 --> 00:50:49,943
and then under `Edit > Application Preferences > File

1317
00:50:50,273 --> 00:50:53,243
and Templates` I need to add that

1318
00:50:53,243 --> 00:50:57,443
folder, so go into my Documents folder

1319
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:02,153
into QCAD, into template and then

1320
00:51:02,183 --> 00:51:04,793
choose that one, click `OK` it says

1321
00:51:04,793 --> 00:51:07,043
you need to restart so we will restart

1322
00:51:07,043 --> 00:51:07,583
QCAD

1323
00:51:08,993 --> 00:51:11,933
and now when you go `File > New

1324
00:51:11,933 --> 00:51:12,983
From Template`

1325
00:51:14,213 --> 00:51:16,463
you will see that you have the

1326
00:51:16,463 --> 00:51:20,603
default folder here, click on `Template`

1327
00:51:20,723 --> 00:51:23,273
`Create New Drawing` there we go and

1328
00:51:23,273 --> 00:51:26,393
it’s got all the layers in there

1329
00:51:26,393 --> 00:51:28,013
as well. So I’m just going to save

1330
00:51:28,013 --> 00:51:29,573
that first of all into the garden

1331
00:51:29,573 --> 00:51:34,193
acre folder, save as and

1332
00:51:34,193 --> 00:51:36,923
and, where are we? We're here so

1333
00:51:36,953 --> 00:51:40,313
call that garden-acre and save

1334
00:51:40,313 --> 00:51:41,903
that in there. The next thing I

1335
00:51:41,903 --> 00:51:43,313
want to do is to bring in

1336
00:51:43,373 --> 00:51:46,943
that satellite photograph so I’ve opened up

1337
00:51:46,973 --> 00:51:49,583
GNU Image Manipulation Program which is

1338
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:52,553
like Photoshop, because I’m on Linux I

1339
00:51:52,553 --> 00:51:53,933
don’t have Photoshop anymore

1340
00:51:55,313 --> 00:51:57,803
use the marquee tool and I’ll select

1341
00:51:57,803 --> 00:52:01,073
that area there and that then gives

1342
00:52:01,073 --> 00:52:03,383
me down here, gives us the size

1343
00:52:03,383 --> 00:52:05,303
of a 114 so that’s

1344
00:52:05,303 --> 00:52:08,513
10 metres divided by a 114

1345
00:52:08,513 --> 00:52:12,143
pixels and that’s metres per pixel

1346
00:52:12,203 --> 00:52:14,513
so 10 metres divided by 114

1347
00:52:14,543 --> 00:52:17,303
is 0.08771…

1348
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:19,583
etc so I’ll just

1349
00:52:19,673 --> 00:52:22,283
save that number and then I’ll use

1350
00:52:22,283 --> 00:52:24,323
that number when I scale down the

1351
00:52:24,323 --> 00:52:27,443
image. So go back into CAD, go

1352
00:52:27,473 --> 00:52:32,483
`File > Import` garden acre and satellite, so

1353
00:52:32,513 --> 00:52:33,593
bring that straight in

1354
00:52:36,023 --> 00:52:37,583
oops, okay, and you can see it’s

1355
00:52:37,583 --> 00:52:40,163
really really really really really big. What

1356
00:52:40,163 --> 00:52:41,363
I want to do is to put

1357
00:52:41,363 --> 00:52:43,283
that into the xSatellite layer, so it’s

1358
00:52:43,283 --> 00:52:46,373
right at the back, that layer down the bottom

1359
00:52:46,373 --> 00:52:48,415
this is the reason

1360
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,883
for having layers is that you

1361
00:52:49,883 --> 00:52:51,503
can just put different stuff on different

1362
00:52:51,503 --> 00:52:53,183
layers and keep it locked up and

1363
00:52:53,183 --> 00:52:54,833
tidied away. So now I

1364
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:56,633
need to scale this image down

1365
00:52:56,663 --> 00:52:58,223
to the right metres per pixel, it’s

1366
00:52:58,223 --> 00:52:59,603
being brought in at 1 meter per pixel

1367
00:52:59,603 --> 00:53:01,493
and I need it to be much

1368
00:53:01,509 --> 00:53:04,073
considerably smaller, so make sure it’s selected

1369
00:53:05,723 --> 00:53:07,221
and then I go to that width

1370
00:53:07,221 --> 00:53:09,293
factor and the height factor, let me

1371
00:53:09,323 --> 00:53:10,643
just pull it over here a little

1372
00:53:10,643 --> 00:53:12,983
bit so you can see, so width

1373
00:53:12,983 --> 00:53:15,983
factor I’ll place in the metres per

1374
00:53:15,983 --> 00:53:19,313
pixel which are calculated from the Photoshop

1375
00:53:19,313 --> 00:53:22,343
file and I’ll paste in that number there

1376
00:53:22,403 --> 00:53:25,313
and there we go that’s much more

1377
00:53:25,313 --> 00:53:30,053
to scale, okay. Another handy little hint

1378
00:53:30,323 --> 00:53:31,883
quite often when you bring in new

1379
00:53:31,913 --> 00:53:33,983
images and new elements they’ll sit on

1380
00:53:33,983 --> 00:53:36,143
top of everything else so if you

1381
00:53:36,143 --> 00:53:38,783
go to `Modify` and then the `Draw Order`

1382
00:53:38,783 --> 00:53:40,343
you can send it to the

1383
00:53:40,343 --> 00:53:41,873
back and that means that you then

1384
00:53:41,933 --> 00:53:43,403
get to see other bits and pieces

1385
00:53:43,403 --> 00:53:44,993
like the legend I’ve got down here.

1386
00:53:45,653 --> 00:53:47,903
So, I’ve created a template, got the

1387
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,941
satellite image in and now I’m going to

1388
00:53:49,941 --> 00:53:53,153
create the boundary, so back into QCAD

1389
00:53:53,183 --> 00:53:55,493
click on the boundary layer because

1390
00:53:55,493 --> 00:53:56,241
this is where I’m going to be

1391
00:53:56,273 --> 00:53:58,343
drawing the boundary and this is a

1392
00:53:58,343 --> 00:54:00,323
lovely house, I just I do like

1393
00:54:00,323 --> 00:54:02,213
it, it’s a nice little

1394
00:54:02,213 --> 00:54:02,543
job

1395
00:54:04,403 --> 00:54:06,233
I wanted to do a a water garden

1396
00:54:06,623 --> 00:54:09,443
And I’m going to use `Snap Free`

1397
00:54:10,223 --> 00:54:11,873
yep, and then I’m using the

1398
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:16,163
line tool here and `Snap Free` and

1399
00:54:16,163 --> 00:54:17,843
then I’m going to trace an outline

1400
00:54:17,843 --> 00:54:19,643
and it’s this field you know this

1401
00:54:19,703 --> 00:54:21,413
field here, I’m going

1402
00:54:21,413 --> 00:54:22,913
to trace an outline around it. It’s

1403
00:54:22,913 --> 00:54:23,813
not going to be particularly

1404
00:54:23,873 --> 00:54:26,303
accurate or particularly pretty but just gives

1405
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,253
you an idea. I could be

1406
00:54:28,253 --> 00:54:30,773
using curves for this as well. I

1407
00:54:30,782 --> 00:54:32,333
could be doing it accurately too!

1408
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:38,063
There we go and then `Snap Auto` because I

1409
00:54:38,063 --> 00:54:39,382
want to snap onto the end of

1410
00:54:39,382 --> 00:54:41,421
that bit there okay. There we go

1411
00:54:41,453 --> 00:54:43,373
hit escape go back to the arrow

1412
00:54:43,373 --> 00:54:46,613
tool. Ah what you can do brilliantly

1413
00:54:46,673 --> 00:54:48,473
really nice little feature you can lock

1414
00:54:48,473 --> 00:54:50,663
layers so I’m going to lock that satellite layer

1415
00:54:51,203 --> 00:54:52,493
and then go back to my boundary layer

1416
00:54:52,613 --> 00:54:53,633
This means I don’t pick up

1417
00:54:53,693 --> 00:54:56,873
the satellite photo by accident

1418
00:54:56,873 --> 00:54:58,733
Now we’ve got that if

1419
00:54:58,733 --> 00:55:00,953
hide, you click on the eye

1420
00:55:01,013 --> 00:55:02,783
it hides a layer so I’ll just

1421
00:55:02,783 --> 00:55:04,613
hide that layer and you can see

1422
00:55:04,643 --> 00:55:06,803
that’s the line that we’ve drawn around

1423
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,423
it. So now

1424
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:11,273
if I double-click on it, it selects

1425
00:55:11,273 --> 00:55:12,382
it, it gives you the

1426
00:55:12,382 --> 00:55:15,353
total length here but it doesn't

1427
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:18,623
give you the area so what I’m

1428
00:55:18,623 --> 00:55:19,823
going to do is make it into

1429
00:55:19,823 --> 00:55:21,533
a polyline which is what I showed you

1430
00:55:21,533 --> 00:55:23,603
earlier on so double-click

1431
00:55:25,043 --> 00:55:30,323
selects all the items, `Draw > Polyline >

1432
00:55:30,323 --> 00:55:31,673
Polyline From Selection`

1433
00:55:33,743 --> 00:55:35,483
And now when I click on it

1434
00:55:35,923 --> 00:55:38,003
it gives us an area so that’s

1435
00:55:38,003 --> 00:55:40,643
3,127

1436
00:55:40,643 --> 00:55:42,653
so basically that’s three quarters of an

1437
00:55:42,653 --> 00:55:45,113
acre which is a fair sized, nice

1438
00:55:45,143 --> 00:55:46,103
sized garden

1439
00:55:48,203 --> 00:55:49,553
I’ll bring the satellite back so we

1440
00:55:49,553 --> 00:55:51,473
can see. So next I’m going to

1441
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,613
put some paths in

1442
00:55:54,113 --> 00:55:56,993
and I’ll just do this on

1443
00:55:56,993 --> 00:55:58,852
the areas. I’m just going to use

1444
00:55:58,853 --> 00:56:00,080
a line tool, I’m not

1445
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:01,793
going do anything really fancy, so line

1446
00:56:01,796 --> 00:56:02,303
tool

1447
00:56:03,653 --> 00:56:05,633
this one here and I know that

1448
00:56:05,633 --> 00:56:08,513
there’s an entrance here, I’ll snap onto

1449
00:56:08,513 --> 00:56:10,607
the entity so that I know that

1450
00:56:10,607 --> 00:56:13,133
it snaps actually onto that line, I think

1451
00:56:13,133 --> 00:56:15,046
the path is around about there and

1452
00:56:15,067 --> 00:56:20,093
I go `Snap Auto` turns it off and

1453
00:56:20,213 --> 00:56:21,503
I think they kind of want a

1454
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,243
path going around here

1455
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:24,843
round the top

1456
00:56:27,603 --> 00:56:29,583
and there’s another exit out there, so

1457
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:32,853
`Snap onto Entity` to snap up to

1458
00:56:32,859 --> 00:56:34,113
there, there we go

1459
00:56:35,343 --> 00:56:37,893
We now have a path going around

1460
00:56:37,893 --> 00:56:39,720
the edge. Turn off the satellite so

1461
00:56:39,753 --> 00:56:41,133
you can see the path. What I

1462
00:56:41,133 --> 00:56:44,103
will do is to offset this so

1463
00:56:44,103 --> 00:56:45,453
you get much more the idea of

1464
00:56:45,453 --> 00:56:47,343
a path, so using the offset tool

1465
00:56:47,643 --> 00:56:49,233
you can draw one line for your

1466
00:56:49,233 --> 00:56:51,093
path and then you can offset it

1467
00:56:51,393 --> 00:56:54,573
both sides or one side and

1468
00:56:54,573 --> 00:56:55,293
then it creates

1469
00:56:55,293 --> 00:56:57,367
the path itself but the size of

1470
00:56:57,367 --> 00:56:58,683
your path depends on how wide

1471
00:56:58,683 --> 00:57:00,213
you want it but if it’s about

1472
00:57:00,243 --> 00:57:02,793
a metre, a metre’s a nice big comfortable path

1473
00:57:03,033 --> 00:57:04,473
down to about 0.4 metres

1474
00:57:04,503 --> 00:57:05,943
for a single person to walk along

1475
00:57:05,973 --> 00:57:07,173
so it depends where the path is and

1476
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:11,103
how you’re using it and so let’s hit escape

1477
00:57:12,123 --> 00:57:14,733
go into the modification tools and then

1478
00:57:14,763 --> 00:57:15,453
offset

1479
00:57:15,963 --> 00:57:18,843
and I’ll offset 0.3 metres

1480
00:57:18,903 --> 00:57:20,583
on each side I’ll just zoom in

1481
00:57:21,303 --> 00:57:23,883
so offset it on that side and

1482
00:57:23,883 --> 00:57:27,213
offset it on that side, okay and

1483
00:57:27,213 --> 00:57:29,373
then I’m going to delete the middle

1484
00:57:29,373 --> 00:57:30,483
bit. And then you’ve got a nice

1485
00:57:30,483 --> 00:57:32,643
little path. Now you could do this using

1486
00:57:32,643 --> 00:57:34,563
the NURBS tool as well. Then next

1487
00:57:34,563 --> 00:57:35,553
up, I want to

1488
00:57:35,613 --> 00:57:37,923
put the trees in so let’s go

1489
00:57:37,953 --> 00:57:40,803
and grab some trees from the forest

1490
00:57:40,803 --> 00:57:43,773
garden blocks. Go back up here, blocks

1491
00:57:43,773 --> 00:57:48,303
forest garden canopy and let’s get a selection

1492
00:57:48,303 --> 00:57:52,353
of trees. Cornus capitata, Cornel…

1493
00:57:52,413 --> 00:57:55,443
Cornus capitata, click that button there

1494
00:57:56,103 --> 00:57:59,793
check that one Bentham's Cornel, Cornus kousa

1495
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:03,633
just escape that, Cornus kousa, click on

1496
00:58:03,633 --> 00:58:07,773
the insert block button, it’s a Chinese Dogwood

1497
00:58:08,643 --> 00:58:10,743
I’ve got to have a hawthorn

1498
00:58:12,783 --> 00:58:14,763
Crataegus schraderiana

1499
00:58:17,553 --> 00:58:19,923
insert block, Blue Hawthorn

1500
00:58:21,033 --> 00:58:23,613
and then I always always always have to

1501
00:58:23,613 --> 00:58:25,503
have a Sweet Chestnut, actually a Sweet

1502
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:28,173
Chestnut won't work because I know it’s

1503
00:58:28,173 --> 00:58:30,453
a damp, oh I’ll put a Sweet Chestnut on anyway

1504
00:58:31,203 --> 00:58:33,053
let’s pretend it’s not damp there, Sweet

1505
00:58:33,053 --> 00:58:35,223
Chestnuts don’t like heavy clay soils

1506
00:58:35,283 --> 00:58:36,123
and I know it’s a heavy

1507
00:58:36,123 --> 00:58:37,353
clay soil there so it won't do

1508
00:58:37,353 --> 00:58:39,363
very well. I’ll just cut them

1509
00:58:41,583 --> 00:58:43,263
and I’ll go over to the tree

1510
00:58:43,263 --> 00:58:47,013
layer in the `Layers List` and

1511
00:58:47,013 --> 00:58:50,193
then paste and there we go, look

1512
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,413
at that, fantastic and then you move the

1513
00:58:52,413 --> 00:58:53,883
trees around so that they’re in

1514
00:58:53,943 --> 00:58:56,493
the right position you know

1515
00:58:56,493 --> 00:58:58,623
they've got enough spacing and there’s enough

1516
00:58:58,653 --> 00:59:00,573
there’s enough spacing around between

1517
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:02,073
the trees and enough light getting through

1518
00:59:02,073 --> 00:59:04,563
to the the bottom canopy floor layer

1519
00:59:06,873 --> 00:59:09,903
Okay now I’m going to put

1520
00:59:09,903 --> 00:59:13,923
in some hedgerows, some hedges so let’s

1521
00:59:13,953 --> 00:59:14,823
open up

1522
00:59:16,143 --> 00:59:18,873
the shrub document from the forest garden

1523
00:59:18,873 --> 00:59:19,563
plants

1524
00:59:21,753 --> 00:59:23,493
and we’ll have a hedge of

1525
00:59:25,983 --> 00:59:28,983
Ligustrum vulgare

1526
00:59:30,843 --> 00:59:32,763
this is a Wild Privet really really

1527
00:59:32,763 --> 00:59:35,403
good wildlife plant, Privet, Ligustrum

1528
00:59:35,433 --> 00:59:36,033
vulgare

1529
00:59:38,133 --> 00:59:39,423
and we go back here and paste

1530
00:59:39,423 --> 00:59:39,783
it in

1531
00:59:40,923 --> 00:59:44,163
and this forms part of the

1532
00:59:44,403 --> 00:59:47,583
design side of things is what

1533
00:59:47,613 --> 00:59:50,163
height wind break you should have

1534
00:59:50,163 --> 00:59:51,633
So on the northside you can see, down

1535
00:59:51,633 --> 00:59:53,643
here you’ve got north-east-west and

1536
00:59:53,643 --> 00:59:55,533
south, on the north side you want

1537
00:59:55,533 --> 00:59:58,770
the tallest wind breaks along there and

1538
00:59:58,893 --> 01:00:01,053
also because that is a road

1539
01:00:01,053 --> 01:00:02,793
there as well you want a

1540
01:00:03,153 --> 01:00:05,013
big tall I would have put a

1541
01:00:05,043 --> 01:00:07,683
double thickness wind break along there, you're

1542
01:00:07,683 --> 01:00:09,543
not going to lose any light, you

1543
01:00:09,543 --> 01:00:11,013
get much more protection and you make

1544
01:00:11,013 --> 01:00:13,653
it thick and right cut down on

1545
01:00:13,653 --> 01:00:14,883
the amount of road noise that you

1546
01:00:14,883 --> 01:00:18,243
get. So Ligustrum vulgare is actually

1547
01:00:18,243 --> 01:00:19,711
not that tall so I wouldn't have

1548
01:00:19,893 --> 01:00:21,213
it, 1.5 metres

1549
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:22,473
I thought it would be bigger

1550
01:00:22,473 --> 01:00:24,273
than that, to 1.5 to

1551
01:00:24,303 --> 01:00:25,143
2 metres

1552
01:00:26,943 --> 01:00:28,293
so that’s a kind of hedge you'd

1553
01:00:28,293 --> 01:00:30,123
have on the south side. So the

1554
01:00:30,123 --> 01:00:33,003
most valuable sunlight comes from the south

1555
01:00:33,003 --> 01:00:35,463
and the west that the air has

1556
01:00:35,463 --> 01:00:36,693
had a time to warm up in

1557
01:00:36,693 --> 01:00:38,913
the afternoon so that the afternoon

1558
01:00:38,913 --> 01:00:41,703
sunlight is more valuable, there’s more photosynthesis

1559
01:00:41,703 --> 01:00:43,083
apparently than in the

1560
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:44,943
morning. I want to put them onto the

1561
01:00:44,943 --> 01:00:45,693
shrub layer

1562
01:00:46,413 --> 01:00:47,343
I put one there

1563
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:49,833
and then one there

1564
01:00:52,683 --> 01:00:53,403
okay

1565
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:00,633
And then to make it a windbreak

1566
01:01:00,633 --> 01:01:02,463
hedge all that I do

1567
01:01:04,683 --> 01:01:05,943
it’s three metres diameter

1568
01:01:07,053 --> 01:01:08,403
all that I’m going do now is

1569
01:01:08,403 --> 01:01:11,733
to draw a line between them, right

1570
01:01:11,733 --> 01:01:13,323
in the centre, the central points, it

1571
01:01:13,323 --> 01:01:15,543
should automatically snap to the reference point

1572
01:01:15,543 --> 01:01:16,383
which is in the middle

1573
01:01:17,763 --> 01:01:22,227
from one to the other. Hit escape and

1574
01:01:22,227 --> 01:01:23,523
now I’m going to use the offset

1575
01:01:23,523 --> 01:01:25,383
tool to put the two sides of

1576
01:01:25,383 --> 01:01:27,363
the hedge on. So the same

1577
01:01:27,363 --> 01:01:29,403
kind of principle as creating a path

1578
01:01:29,673 --> 01:01:33,453
so modification tools, offset tool and I

1579
01:01:33,453 --> 01:01:35,613
know that the width of the Privet

1580
01:01:35,613 --> 01:01:37,773
hedge will be 3 metres diameter

1581
01:01:37,773 --> 01:01:40,113
or 3 metres width, so it’s

1582
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,033
1.5 metres for one side

1583
01:01:42,033 --> 01:01:43,743
1.5 metres for the other side

1584
01:01:44,733 --> 01:01:46,623
So a distance 1.5

1585
01:01:49,323 --> 01:01:50,913
bomp and that one bomp

1586
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:54,333
Delete the middle one now

1587
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:55,953
There you go, we now have

1588
01:01:57,153 --> 01:01:58,503
a windbreak. And then I would

1589
01:01:58,503 --> 01:02:01,143
do wind breaks around the

1590
01:02:01,143 --> 01:02:03,273
edges. A big part of the design

1591
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:05,523
is figuring out how the different areas

1592
01:02:05,523 --> 01:02:07,563
are going to be used and a

1593
01:02:07,563 --> 01:02:09,243
fundamental element of that design which I

1594
01:02:09,273 --> 01:02:13,683
cover in my design class is creating

1595
01:02:13,743 --> 01:02:16,203
the areas through the use of paths

1596
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:17,133
So you create

1597
01:02:17,184 --> 01:02:19,233
the paths first, you create the structure

1598
01:02:19,233 --> 01:02:21,333
of the garden first of all and

1599
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:22,863
then you can bring in the different

1600
01:02:22,863 --> 01:02:24,933
planting around and the features around that

1601
01:02:26,373 --> 01:02:28,803
okay so what I would do

1602
01:02:29,553 --> 01:02:31,443
after this I would create

1603
01:02:31,473 --> 01:02:33,393
different windbreaks all the way around so

1604
01:02:33,393 --> 01:02:34,653
you would always want to have

1605
01:02:34,653 --> 01:02:36,843
windbreaks surrounding your garden to reduce

1606
01:02:36,843 --> 01:02:38,883
the amount of turbulence particularly with

1607
01:02:38,883 --> 01:02:41,313
the Climate Emergency because there’s going to

1608
01:02:41,313 --> 01:02:42,993
be more and more extreme weather events

1609
01:02:44,414 --> 01:02:45,813
There we go and that’s that

1610
01:02:45,813 --> 01:02:48,723
one done. And now onto creating the

1611
01:02:48,753 --> 01:02:50,043
garden town

1612
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:53,013
So as I said before, the satellite

1613
01:02:53,013 --> 01:02:54,603
really is just a rough guide. I’ll

1614
01:02:54,633 --> 01:02:56,433
do it from the satellite now but what

1615
01:02:56,433 --> 01:02:57,543
you want to be doing is creating

1616
01:02:57,543 --> 01:02:59,223
your plan from actual measurements on the

1617
01:02:59,223 --> 01:03:02,163
ground and just get general information from

1618
01:03:02,163 --> 01:03:03,715
the maps, okay, so this is what

1619
01:03:03,715 --> 01:03:05,853
we're going to be doing so let’s go

1620
01:03:05,853 --> 01:03:08,073
and create a new file, save that

1621
01:03:08,073 --> 01:03:10,563
one, create a new file from template

1622
01:03:12,363 --> 01:03:14,553
And I’m going to save that as garden

1623
01:03:14,613 --> 01:03:18,513
town, okay, go up the level, garden town

1624
01:03:18,543 --> 01:03:20,883
and this is garden town,

1625
01:03:20,883 --> 01:03:21,363
garden-town

1626
01:03:23,343 --> 01:03:26,313
great stuff then go over to

1627
01:03:26,343 --> 01:03:30,093
my image bitmap editor, zoom down

1628
01:03:30,093 --> 01:03:30,603
here

1629
01:03:31,923 --> 01:03:35,913
Use a rectangular marquee tool and select that

1630
01:03:38,163 --> 01:03:39,393
and you can see that the width

1631
01:03:39,393 --> 01:03:40,983
the marquee is a 110 pixels

1632
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:44,553
so that is 5 metres and

1633
01:03:44,553 --> 01:03:46,233
110 pixels that’s

1634
01:03:46,263 --> 01:03:48,813
5 divided by 110 gives

1635
01:03:48,813 --> 01:03:51,093
you your metres per pixel, so

1636
01:03:52,803 --> 01:03:55,413
5 divided by 110

1637
01:03:55,773 --> 01:03:56,523
gives you that.

1638
01:03:57,693 --> 01:04:00,993
Lovely. And now go back into QCAD

1639
01:04:01,623 --> 01:04:08,373
select the satellite layer, file import and

1640
01:04:09,123 --> 01:04:10,113
it’s going to make me go all the

1641
01:04:10,113 --> 01:04:11,433
way back obviously

1642
01:04:12,783 --> 01:04:15,363
examples, garden town, satellite

1643
01:04:17,133 --> 01:04:17,913
pop that in there

1644
01:04:19,743 --> 01:04:21,333
See, really really really big it is

1645
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:24,390
Let’s select it and then the width

1646
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:26,973
factor, whoops, I’ll just pop that up here

1647
01:04:26,973 --> 01:04:27,393
for you

1648
01:04:29,043 --> 01:04:31,413
that’s the width factor here, so paste

1649
01:04:31,413 --> 01:04:32,943
in that value which is the metres

1650
01:04:32,943 --> 01:04:34,833
per pixel, paste that value in there

1651
01:04:35,643 --> 01:04:37,563
and you can see it shrinks right the

1652
01:04:37,563 --> 01:04:40,353
way down, weeee, that’s better, and now

1653
01:04:40,353 --> 01:04:42,573
it’s to scale and then just to

1654
01:04:42,573 --> 01:04:43,683
get it, can you see

1655
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:49,413
`Modify > Draw Order > Send to Back`

1656
01:04:50,537 --> 01:04:51,783
and then you can see

1657
01:04:51,783 --> 01:04:51,993
the

1658
01:04:53,913 --> 01:04:56,853
compass, the legend there as well lovely

1659
01:04:56,853 --> 01:04:57,783
I’ll lock that layer

1660
01:04:59,403 --> 01:05:01,683
So this is a friend's garden in

1661
01:05:01,923 --> 01:05:04,143
North London, I worked on a few

1662
01:05:04,143 --> 01:05:04,863
years ago now

1663
01:05:06,633 --> 01:05:08,583
okay, going to pop the `Property Editor`

1664
01:05:08,583 --> 01:05:10,983
there and it’s this one here, so

1665
01:05:10,983 --> 01:05:12,243
I’m just going to do this really

1666
01:05:12,243 --> 01:05:15,333
really really basically so start off with

1667
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:18,963
the boundary so select the boundary layer

1668
01:05:20,073 --> 01:05:22,593
click on the line tool, this one

1669
01:05:22,593 --> 01:05:24,213
the only one I ever use

1670
01:05:24,225 --> 01:05:27,123
`LI` and then we’ll just click

1671
01:05:27,693 --> 01:05:34,173
click, click, click, click, and that’s it

1672
01:05:34,953 --> 01:05:36,393
double-click it and you can see

1673
01:05:36,393 --> 01:05:37,953
if I just turn off the satellite

1674
01:05:39,003 --> 01:05:40,983
that’s it, it’s a bit rough and ready

1675
01:05:41,343 --> 01:05:44,253
double-click it and then we’ll turn

1676
01:05:44,253 --> 01:05:46,593
that into a polyline and then we

1677
01:05:46,593 --> 01:05:48,933
can see how big it is, so

1678
01:05:48,963 --> 01:05:50,883
`Draw Polyline From Selection`

1679
01:05:52,203 --> 01:05:54,783
and that gives me an area of

1680
01:05:54,783 --> 01:05:57,723
102 metres, so that’s

1681
01:05:57,723 --> 01:05:59,163
how big their garden is

1682
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:00,513
so it’s a bit under the

1683
01:06:00,753 --> 01:06:03,753
average, the average for a UK London garden

1684
01:06:03,783 --> 01:06:06,723
is a 140 square metres

1685
01:06:06,753 --> 01:06:08,493
and theirs comes in at just over

1686
01:06:08,493 --> 01:06:12,093
100 square metres okay

1687
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:14,403
so then what I would do is

1688
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:15,783
to put the path in

1689
01:06:17,313 --> 01:06:20,553
in areas and this is where sometimes

1690
01:06:20,553 --> 01:06:21,603
you want to change the colours of

1691
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:22,953
your layers so you can actually see

1692
01:06:22,953 --> 01:06:23,943
what's going on, as you can see

1693
01:06:23,943 --> 01:06:25,323
from this you can hardly,

1694
01:06:25,323 --> 01:06:27,033
you can't actually see the red

1695
01:06:27,453 --> 01:06:29,283
on that boundary on this particular image

1696
01:06:29,433 --> 01:06:31,263
so this is where you would play

1697
01:06:31,263 --> 01:06:33,183
around with the different colours, so we’ll get

1698
01:06:33,183 --> 01:06:35,433
the, ah the kitchen door is around

1699
01:06:35,433 --> 01:06:36,273
about here somewhere

1700
01:06:37,708 --> 01:06:38,908
and say oh we want a new

1701
01:06:38,908 --> 01:06:40,708
path and that path goes up to

1702
01:06:40,708 --> 01:06:41,008
here

1703
01:06:42,058 --> 01:06:42,838
up to the shed

1704
01:06:44,968 --> 01:06:45,538
okay

1705
01:06:47,188 --> 01:06:49,198
ah let’s just turn off that satellite

1706
01:06:49,198 --> 01:06:50,128
so you can see what's going on

1707
01:06:50,128 --> 01:06:51,148
so that’s my path

1708
01:06:53,428 --> 01:06:54,748
I’ll make it into a polyline so it’s

1709
01:06:54,748 --> 01:06:58,048
easier to use so `Draw > Polyline

1710
01:06:58,048 --> 01:07:00,868
Polyline From Selection` and that sets it as

1711
01:07:00,881 --> 01:07:01,318
a group

1712
01:07:03,598 --> 01:07:04,138
and then

1713
01:07:06,118 --> 01:07:07,438
oh let’s go and put the the

1714
01:07:07,438 --> 01:07:08,968
shed in, there’s a shed down here

1715
01:07:08,968 --> 01:07:11,728
in the bottom left-hand corner so

1716
01:07:13,108 --> 01:07:14,818
I’ll go into my shape tools

1717
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:17,608
and I’ll just draw it freehand

1718
01:07:19,318 --> 01:07:23,008
so `Snap Free` so it

1719
01:07:23,008 --> 01:07:25,708
doesn't snap onto anything else

1720
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:30,628
I’ll do that there, there we go I’ve

1721
01:07:30,628 --> 01:07:32,608
gone and drawn it into the

1722
01:07:32,608 --> 01:07:36,868
areas layer, so how you move

1723
01:07:36,868 --> 01:07:39,028
it in the `Property Editor` is to

1724
01:07:39,028 --> 01:07:40,708
select the thing that you want

1725
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:43,408
to move and then change the

1726
01:07:44,548 --> 01:07:45,838
the layer that it’s in. I

1727
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:47,098
want to put it into the Structures

1728
01:07:47,098 --> 01:07:48,568
layer and there you will see, it will

1729
01:07:48,578 --> 01:07:50,818
automatically change colour down here, we just

1730
01:07:50,818 --> 01:07:52,198
turn off the satellite so you can

1731
01:07:52,198 --> 01:07:55,318
see, okay? Double-click it, I’ll turn it

1732
01:07:55,318 --> 01:07:58,018
into a block actually `Create Block

1733
01:07:58,018 --> 01:07:58,708
From Selection`

1734
01:08:01,078 --> 01:08:03,388
Okay and I’m going to call that shed and

1735
01:08:03,388 --> 01:08:04,078
then you’ll see

1736
01:08:07,798 --> 01:08:10,678
the shed will appear here in the

1737
01:08:10,678 --> 01:08:12,328
`Block List`, okay?

1738
01:08:15,808 --> 01:08:17,968
And then it’s the same principle now

1739
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:20,398
as well for putting in trees and

1740
01:08:20,428 --> 01:08:23,098
shrubs I’ve got my forest

1741
01:08:23,098 --> 01:08:24,988
garden plants blocks here, I’ll put up

1742
01:08:25,078 --> 01:08:29,008
a hazel down here, Corylus avellana so

1743
01:08:29,008 --> 01:08:30,718
the big name’s the common name

1744
01:08:31,048 --> 01:08:33,627
and then the botanical name’s underneath

1745
01:08:34,258 --> 01:08:35,787
and the botanical names is

1746
01:08:35,787 --> 01:08:37,108
in the list, in the `Layer List`

1747
01:08:37,287 --> 01:08:38,308
so let’s cut that

1748
01:08:39,598 --> 01:08:42,328
go over to the garden town go

1749
01:08:42,328 --> 01:08:43,287
to shrub

1750
01:08:45,358 --> 01:08:47,728
paste it in there, wow, much much

1751
01:08:47,728 --> 01:08:50,768
bigger it’s a town garden so the

1752
01:08:51,508 --> 01:08:54,118
trees obviously much larger size, so there

1753
01:08:54,118 --> 01:08:55,078
we go and then you can do

1754
01:08:55,078 --> 01:08:57,898
that with individual beds with the paths

1755
01:08:58,048 --> 01:09:00,688
putting plants in, putting different features in

1756
01:09:01,678 --> 01:09:04,587
greenhouses, patios, all that kind

1757
01:09:04,587 --> 01:09:06,148
of stuff, then you start to build

1758
01:09:06,148 --> 01:09:08,037
up the design for the garden but

1759
01:09:08,037 --> 01:09:10,198
as I said before, the most important

1760
01:09:10,198 --> 01:09:12,718
thing when you're creating these designs is

1761
01:09:12,718 --> 01:09:15,417
to get the spacing right between the

1762
01:09:15,868 --> 01:09:17,818
trees, make sure that they've

1763
01:09:17,818 --> 01:09:19,377
got the paths in the right

1764
01:09:19,377 --> 01:09:21,898
place, so getting the structure in the

1765
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:24,568
The smaller planting is much much easier

1766
01:09:24,568 --> 01:09:24,747
to do

1767
01:09:24,747 --> 01:09:26,488
on-site so you don’t have

1768
01:09:26,488 --> 01:09:28,198
to be so precise about

1769
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:30,298
the designs for them but

1770
01:09:30,298 --> 01:09:32,247
it’s really really important to get the

1771
01:09:32,247 --> 01:09:34,287
trees and the paths and the main

1772
01:09:34,287 --> 01:09:37,078
structures in place first. And that brings us

1773
01:09:37,078 --> 01:09:39,654
to a close and what I also have

1774
01:09:40,648 --> 01:09:44,127
a whole load of resources, so there’s the

1775
01:09:44,127 --> 01:09:44,908
link for downloading

1776
01:09:44,908 --> 01:09:46,917
QCAD, they've got the cad files

1777
01:09:46,917 --> 01:09:50,457
for this class, I’ve also created

1778
01:09:50,488 --> 01:09:53,368
a public Telegram group called Garden Wild

1779
01:09:53,368 --> 01:09:55,558
Edible which goes along with these classes

1780
01:09:55,798 --> 01:09:57,298
and that’s a space if you want

1781
01:09:57,298 --> 01:10:00,208
to ask any questions, then feel free

1782
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:01,918
to join and then ask questions if

1783
01:10:01,918 --> 01:10:03,688
you’ve got any questions about QCAD

1784
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:05,068
kind of technical

1785
01:10:05,068 --> 01:10:06,748
stuff then there’s a QCAD

1786
01:10:06,748 --> 01:10:09,328
link to QCAD forum, there’s my template

1787
01:10:09,328 --> 01:10:12,778
my delicious CAD template file

1788
01:10:12,778 --> 01:10:15,178
native plants spreadsheet which I haven't shown

1789
01:10:15,178 --> 01:10:16,348
you which I ought to show you

1790
01:10:16,648 --> 01:10:20,518
and the forest garden spreadsheet

1791
01:10:20,518 --> 01:10:22,738
I will be using these more

1792
01:10:22,738 --> 01:10:25,195
in the design section of

1793
01:10:25,228 --> 01:10:27,928
the classes. So the Garden Wild Spreadsheet

1794
01:10:27,958 --> 01:10:30,238
is a list of native plants, it’s

1795
01:10:30,238 --> 01:10:31,858
flowers just at the moment, I’ve got

1796
01:10:31,948 --> 01:10:36,058
space for other native forms but the

1797
01:10:36,088 --> 01:10:37,888
Forest Garden Spreadsheet is a list of

1798
01:10:37,888 --> 01:10:39,538
all the forest garden plants in

1799
01:10:39,539 --> 01:10:41,368
Martin Crawford's book as well so loads and

1800
01:10:41,368 --> 01:10:43,888
loads of information there and then you’ve

1801
01:10:43,888 --> 01:10:45,388
got my CAD blocks too

1802
01:10:45,388 --> 01:10:47,038
That draws us to an end

1803
01:10:47,038 --> 01:10:49,258
I hope that’s useful, if you do want

1804
01:10:49,258 --> 01:10:50,548
to get in touch with me, my

1805
