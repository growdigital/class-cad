00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,956
Greetings and welcome, my name is Jake

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,930
Rayson, I am a wildlife and food

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,090
forest garden designer and welcome to my

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,390
online class ‘CAD for Gardeners’, this is

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,250
a beginner's guide so this is aimed

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,380
at beginners but also people who are keen

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,830
to get cracking really quickly with using

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,470
computer aided design for their garden creations

9
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,440
A couple of notes before we get started. First

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,600
of all this slideshow is always available

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,333
online natureworks.org.uk/class/cad

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,120
If you press the key `P` on

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,950
your keyboard, it brings up all the

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,050
notes and there’s some interesting links and

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,640
extra information in there as well

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,030
So without further ado let’s get cracking

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,630
An outline for today - why CAD?

18
00:00:45,632 --> 00:00:46,950
why would you bother using CAD in

19
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,720
the first place? Indeed, why would you

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,390
bother planning in the first place? And

21
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,430
then I’m going to look at setting

22
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,290
up QCAD and QCAD is the

23
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,410
software that I use for CAD designs

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,977
Going through step by step

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,800
on how to set it up so that it

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,790
all works nicely

27
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,390
The third section is looking at shapes

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,910
entities and mods. Basically the simple

29
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,100
shapes, there’s four simple shapes that if you

30
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,980
learn, you can create an infinite variety

31
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,830
of shapes by combining them, and using

32
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,060
entities to rotate stuff, and modifications to

33
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,520
alter all these different elements as well

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,000
So we’ll be

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,460
learning four basic shapes, three types of

36
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,780
entity and four modifications. And then finally

37
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,720
I’ll be looking at two examples, a

38
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,750
one acre garden and a town

39
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,880
garden and I’ll be walking through

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,700
step-by-step how to create them. So

41
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,630
why CAD?

42
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,560
A very good question! A bit of background first

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,440
of all. There is, as you might

44
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,630
well be aware, a nature and climate

45
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,990
emergency and gardens need to be a

46
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,830
wildlife haven with crops, with edible crops

47
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,570
I will give you a definition of

48
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,760
what a forest garden is because that’s my

49
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,840
gardening background

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,180
But I think in general terms

51
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,250
this world needs more gardeners and it

52
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,560
needs more gardeners who are aware of

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,810
the issues surrounding the nature and

54
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,350
the climate emergency, so changing conditions and

55
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,440
a massive, massive, massive decrease in the

56
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,720
in the number of species. This is

57
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,970
why we need all of this

58
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,570
new gardens to be planned and that’s

59
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,250
where the CAD side comes in

60
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,750
because it can make the process a

61
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,090
lot easier. So what is a forest

62
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,550
garden, I’ll just give you an overview

63
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,200
A forest garden

64
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,938
to quote Martin Crawford's fantastic book which

65
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,270
I refer to all the

66
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,310
time, Martin Crawford is a great

67
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,380
chap down in Devon and been creating

68
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,760
forest gardens for years and years and

69
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,470
years, and this is a bit of

70
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,510
a bible. It goes through a

71
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,630
whole range of different processes for setting

72
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,490
up a forest garden and all the

73
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,260
load of different species as well

74
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,660
And as he says, ‘it’s working with

75
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,480
nature to grow edible crops’ and this

76
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,210
is a photograph here from his garden

77
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,820
in Devon and what we’re doing is

78
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,240
to emulate the edge of woodland because

79
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,790
you want to have crops in the

80
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,950
understory and you want to have enough light

81
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,660
coming through. So it’s not thick dense

82
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,460
woodland, it’s the edge of woodland and

83
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,230
then you have different layers of plants

84
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,980
occupying that space. And it’s a

85
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,740
very good system because it uses

86
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,110
natural pest control and fertility, so you

87
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,420
grow all your fertility on site. So

88
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,310
essentially what you’re doing is to create

89
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,730
an edible ecosystem. What is CAD? I’m

90
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:38,880
very

91
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,010
glad you asked it is Computer Aided

92
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,050
Design. That’s a link there to the

93
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,050
Wikipedia article. Basically it’s a

94
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,230
line based drawing package; you’re creating precise

95
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,230
line diagrams and it’s used mostly in

96
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,690
architecture and manufacturing, where you need a

97
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,790
great deal of precision we don’t really

98
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,040
need that precision in gardening. It’s

99
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,500
kind of useful but that’s not the

100
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,750
the major reason for using it. If

101
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,820
you compare it to drawing programs like

102
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:10,140
Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape, the massive difference is

103
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,630
that CAD is far, far more scalable

104
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,550
and far faster. It doesn’t look as

105
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,890
pretty but it does, in my humble

106
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,810
opinion, it does the job a lot better

107
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,510
And we’re looking at 2D CAD, two

108
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,910
dimensional CAD, and this basically means that

109
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,460
it’s just in two dimensions

110
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,350
viewing it from above, and that’s a

111
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,830
plan view. I use Open Source CAD

112
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,620
a package called QCAD which I absolutely

113
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,720
love. It’s brilliant, really lovely piece

114
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,360
of software. Open Source software

115
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,820
means the code for the software is

116
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,630
freely available online and the very

117
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,810
cool thing is that the price is

118
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,460
so much cheaper than any kind of

119
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,880
commercial software. The industry standard Vectorworks costs

120
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,550
£1,230

121
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,340
per year, it’s a subscription model, and

122
00:04:59,340 --> 00:04:59,520
that

123
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,460
is just kind of outrageous and

124
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,320
to be honest, the free version of

125
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,510
QCAD is more than adequate for

126
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,210
CAD garden design. There is an alternative

127
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,100
to QCAD which is totally free called

128
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,870
LibreCAD and there’s a link in

129
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,500
the notes. I actually pay for the

130
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,960
paid version of QCAD, I paid about

131
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,680
£41

132
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,240
I think it is and the

133
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,980
reason for that really is to support

134
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,810
the developer because you have something which

135
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,940
is a good piece of software you want

136
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,770
the developer to keep on

137
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,000
working at it and to fix any

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,710
bugs and progress with it

139
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,380
There is a QCAD book as

140
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,560
well. Totally recommend getting that book, even

141
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,120
with the free version because there’s a

142
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,780
whole load of

143
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,550
information, there’s a lot of detail

144
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,840
there’s quite a stuff that you won’t

145
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,990
need but I’ll go through today showing

146
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,250
you the key points and you can

147
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,630
refer to them in the book

148
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,680
Do you even need CAD? You might

149
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,360
be better off using paper

150
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,290
if you’re only doing one design and

151
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,100
you’re not that comfortable using computers

152
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,710
5mm graph paper is

153
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,820
really good, I mean it’s a really

154
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,860
really good medium and it’s far freer

155
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,500
and in a lot of ways more flexible than

156
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,420
CAD but it’s not as easy to

157
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,440
work with if you’re working in a

158
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,480
group. This is the

159
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:15,600
5mm

160
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,680
grid that you can see there!

161
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,230
If you’re working with a group of

162
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,800
people or people who are distributed around geographically

163
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,600
you actually might be better off learning

164
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,110
CAD. Whatever you do use, get the

165
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,330
scale right. really really important to always

166
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,010
get the scale right. So that anything that

167
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,360
you add, any elements that you add

168
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,610
later on, will fit into that

169
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,530
And if you click on this image

170
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,260
it gives you a higher resolution, isn't

171
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,250
that fantastic?

172
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,570
So the CAD pros are that it’s

173
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,210
1:1 within the program itself

174
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,650
and what this means is you don’t

175
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,180
have to scale the drawing in the

176
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,910
software. If you’re creating a twenty metre

177
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,130
by twenty metre garden, you draw it as

178
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,260
twenty metres by twenty metres in the

179
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,170
software. This is as compared to using

180
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:01,920
Adobe Illustrator

181
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,142
where you have to scale

182
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,150
the drawing down, otherwise it slows the

183
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,430
program up too much. And that’s the

184
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,990
other thing about CAD as well, it’s

185
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,150
super fast. I run it on really

186
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,390
really ancient old PCs and it’s great

187
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,460
It’s just really really fast and it’s

188
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,370
accurate. It can slow down

189
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,050
if you’ve got thousands of plants on

190
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,300
there but there’s no need to worry

191
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,970
about the power of your PC. And

192
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,680
it’s easy to edit, as compared to

193
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,840
a paper plan where it can get

194
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,430
messy, and the more elements that you

195
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,630
have on a paper plan, and the

196
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,370
more you move things around the messier

197
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,500
it can get, whether you’re working with overlays

198
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,240
or whether you’re rubbing things out or

199
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,890
you’ve got little cutout bits of paper

200
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,240
to represent plants -

201
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,100
that can get a little bit

202
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,680
messy whereas you don’t have that with

203
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,800
using CAD. And it’s portable as well

204
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,880
This means that you can easily email

205
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,100
people a CAD file and you can

206
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,930
print it out as a PDF file

207
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,270
a Portable Document Format, and email that

208
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,410
to people too

209
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,620
The cons of using CAD are that it

210
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,900
is technical. I won’t lie to you

211
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,870
there is a steep learning curve to

212
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,000
it. You’ve got to put the hours

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,100
in to learn the software. But once

214
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,600
you do, and this is why it’s

215
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,950
worth it if you’re creating more than

216
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,530
one design, once you do master those

217
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,050
essential skills, then your workflow will

218
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:22,500
be much

219
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,440
quicker. And it is ugly. It’s not

220
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,230
designed to look pretty. So a nice

221
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,170
thing about Adobe Illustrator is that you

222
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,299
can create lots of shading and

223
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,470
different styles

224
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,110
But to be honest, if that’s what

225
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,250
you want to do, I would actually

226
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,350
suggest doing that within CAD and then

227
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,539
exporting that and then bringing that into

228
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,460
a different program to make it look prettier

229
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,570
Reasons to plan. In my book

230
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,000
there are five main reasons to plan

231
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,800
whether you’re using CAD or whether you’re

232
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,080
using paper. The first of these is

233
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,680
to get the spacing

234
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,960
right. In a forest garden, as

235
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,650
I mentioned before, the idea is to emulate

236
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,420
the edge of woodland, so you want

237
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,830
to have enough light coming through for

238
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,600
the understory and getting that spacing between

239
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,610
the trees is really really essential. That’s

240
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,380
like the main framework of the garden

241
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,790
design. The second reason is the position

242
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,780
and positioning of the

243
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,260
plants and positioning of the different features

244
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,440
within the garden and it’s much easier

245
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,330
with a plan to get an overview

246
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,950
of what’s going on in different parts

247
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,120
of the garden and how they relate to

248
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,600
each other

249
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,700
The third reason is quantity. CAD is absolutely

250
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,030
brilliant at calculating areas and lengths and you

251
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,830
can calc, from that you can work

252
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,740
out the quantity of plants that you require. Fourth

253
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,050
reason is communicate, so you’re communicating with

254
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,150
clients and you’re communicating with other people

255
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,550
you’re working with, whether that’s landscapers or

256
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,900
people who are putting the

257
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,140
plants out. And then finally documenting. Once

258
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,600
you’ve created your garden, it’s always

259
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,040
a good idea to know where things are

260
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,690
So tree spacing. This is an

261
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,940
illustration which has been inspired by Martin

262
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,310
Crawford’s book and this is tree spacing

263
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,880
within a forest garden. Martin Crawford

264
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,120
recommends

265
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,600
tree spacing of quarter to a half

266
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,940
of the average canopy diameter. So for

267
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,590
example you’ve got two 4 metre

268
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,990
diameter trees, then the tree spacing that

269
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,420
you want between them is 1 to

270
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,970
2 metres and that’s because you want

271
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,339
to get enough light coming through

272
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:26,970
Position

273
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,890
This is because a plan will enable

274
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,900
you to play with ideas far more

275
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,670
easily. If you’re trying to do it all

276
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,320
from memory, it could be hard to

277
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,570
remember where different things are. If you’ve

278
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,830
got a large site and you’re out

279
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,660
on site you can have great ideas

280
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,790
but it’s having somewhere to put all

281
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,120
those ideas. So it also

282
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,040
enables you, a plan, to try these

283
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,930
different positions quickly, so you can put

284
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,460
a tree in one place and then

285
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,290
put it into a totally opposite corner

286
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,660
of the garden very very quickly. And

287
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,980
it gives you an overview of the

288
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,140
different conditions within that garden, so like

289
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,570
where the water is or where the

290
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,400
light is rising and the sun

291
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:05,940
is setting

292
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,460
CAD is absolutely brilliant at working out

293
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,140
estimates, so you can figure out the

294
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,290
quantities of plants. This is a screenshot

295
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,970
from a design that I did for

296
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,900
a relatively small garden locally, and you

297
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,090
can see there’s an area here called Curve

298
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,320
it’s a kind of curved bed

299
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,270
and I can work

300
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,250
out really quickly that that’s 6

301
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,550
metres square. Likewise, there’s a line measuring

302
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,140
tool as well. And once you’ve got

303
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,370
an area and you know what your

304
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,440
planting density is, then it’s easy to

305
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,890
calculate how many plants you need. Likewise

306
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,140
if you’re planning a hedge, you know

307
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,730
how long that hedge is going to

308
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,900
be and you’ve got your planting

309
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,400
density for the

310
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,800
hedging plants then it’s again

311
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,840
very easy to calculate the quantities required

312
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,040
So, it works really really well with

313
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,450
a spreadsheet. For each of my

314
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,050
clients I create an online spreadsheet of

315
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,150
all the different plants and then I

316
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,070
can work out quantities from that and prices

317
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:05,820
from that as well

318
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,940
The fourth reason to create a plan

319
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,936
is the ability to communicate and that’s

320
00:12:14,936 --> 00:12:17,340
sharing ideas with partners, whether that’s clients

321
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,930
or other people that you’re working with

322
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,020
Really, a plan is like itself a

323
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,677
landscaping and a planting guide, so you’ve

324
00:12:25,677 --> 00:12:27,030
got any hard landscaping that you need

325
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,380
doing, any paths that need to be

326
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,960
put in or fencing, then people will

327
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,720
know the lengths and the dimensions. And

328
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,700
likewise with the planting guide, people know the

329
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,960
quantities of plants that need to be

330
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,460
put in and what densities are going

331
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,130
in at. And I always kind of

332
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,890
create online notes for each my clients

333
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,180
and then I can share a

334
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,830
PDF of the plan

335
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,200
and the original CAD file with

336
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,210
with my clients that way, so they’ll

337
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,610
see it. And a plan is fantastic

338
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,110
as a guide for your future self

339
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,790
as well, so very often you think

340
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,470
you’ll know what you’re doing with the

341
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,490
design and what you’re doing with the

342
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,100
planting but if you write it down

343
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,710
is like an aide de memoire, it really

344
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,260
really helps. So, your future self will

345
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,460
thank you if you do

346
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,000
create a plan. The fifth reason is

347
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,660
to document your planting. Where on

348
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,130
earth did you put those plants? I’m

349
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,930
sure everyone's had this before in the

350
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,510
past, you can’t remember what plant is

351
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,800
in which bed, so if you have

352
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,506
a plan, it then changes the process and

353
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,040
it becomes a document that you can

354
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,080
refer to and it tells you where

355
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,330
your plants are. And don’t forget like

356
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,740
the seasonal differences in the middle of

357
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,530
winter then all herbaceous perennials would

358
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,060
have died down so they're not going to

359
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,490
be so visible. It’s also a really

360
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,920
good document to educate the partners with

361
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,740
And management is a top priority, even

362
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,670
though it’s at the bottom of the

363
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,670
the list. I think working out how

364
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,710
a garden will be cared for and

365
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,590
managed long-term is really really important. So

366
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,150
if you’ve got a document in

367
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,830
