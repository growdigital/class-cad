00:45:43,229 --> 00:45:46,663
Greetings and welcome to section four of my online

2
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:49,423
class ‘CAD for Gardeners’ and here I’m

3
00:45:49,453 --> 00:45:50,053
going be looking at

4
00:45:50,053 --> 00:45:52,753
a couple of real world examples. First

5
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:54,313
of all I’m looking at an

6
00:45:54,403 --> 00:45:56,773
average sized garden in the UK

7
00:45:57,223 --> 00:45:58,813
so that you can get an idea

8
00:45:58,813 --> 00:46:00,643
of scale and how that compares to

9
00:46:00,763 --> 00:46:03,673
compares with an acre which is a

10
00:46:03,703 --> 00:46:06,493
traditional UK area of land

11
00:46:07,393 --> 00:46:08,743
Then I’ll be looking at using a

12
00:46:08,743 --> 00:46:10,213
satellite photograph

13
00:46:10,213 --> 00:46:12,793
a screenshot of a satellite photograph

14
00:46:12,893 --> 00:46:15,383
as a background for a CAD

15
00:46:15,383 --> 00:46:18,623
plan which works better with the larger

16
00:46:18,653 --> 00:46:20,993
garden and then the actual

17
00:46:20,993 --> 00:46:23,573
gardens themselves and these are real clients

18
00:46:23,603 --> 00:46:26,003
that I’ve had, ones about an acre for

19
00:46:26,003 --> 00:46:27,683
the garden and ones a town

20
00:46:27,683 --> 00:46:30,850
garden. So the average garden in the

21
00:46:30,863 --> 00:46:33,429
UK is a 188 square metres

22
00:46:33,439 --> 00:46:35,873
apparently, according to the Office of

23
00:46:35,873 --> 00:46:39,233
National Statistics. In London that’s 140

24
00:46:39,233 --> 00:46:42,233
140 square metres and that compares

25
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:44,866
to an acre which is 4,000 square metres

26
00:46:44,866 --> 00:46:45,833
and you can see here

27
00:46:46,163 --> 00:46:49,313
in this image that there is the

28
00:46:49,313 --> 00:46:50,513
one acre, the one on the left-hand

29
00:46:50,513 --> 00:46:51,773
side and then this garden on the

30
00:46:51,773 --> 00:46:53,093
right-hand side. Should be able to

31
00:46:53,153 --> 00:46:54,593
this is a screenshot that

32
00:46:54,593 --> 00:46:56,123
I did so you can just see

33
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:59,093
how they compare and forest

34
00:46:59,093 --> 00:47:02,933
gardens do tend to be a

35
00:47:02,933 --> 00:47:04,493
bit larger than your

36
00:47:04,493 --> 00:47:07,373
average garden, mostly because they have

37
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:09,083
more trees and more people

38
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:10,973
think about them in

39
00:47:10,973 --> 00:47:12,563
that way but you can have a

40
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:13,313
forest garden

41
00:47:13,343 --> 00:47:15,473
in a small garden, it’s much more

42
00:47:15,623 --> 00:47:18,563
about the process and the principles than

43
00:47:18,563 --> 00:47:20,483
it is about the actual size

44
00:47:20,483 --> 00:47:23,333
of the garden. So now looking at

45
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:25,253
a satellite photograph this is a

46
00:47:25,253 --> 00:47:26,393
3D version but we're going to use

47
00:47:26,393 --> 00:47:29,003
the 2D plan. There’s three steps

48
00:47:29,003 --> 00:47:32,303
to using a satellite photograph as a

49
00:47:32,306 --> 00:47:33,473
background for

50
00:47:33,473 --> 00:47:35,723
your CAD plan. First one is to take

51
00:47:35,723 --> 00:47:38,873
a screenshot, then we work out the

52
00:47:38,873 --> 00:47:41,303
metres per pixel and then we import

53
00:47:41,303 --> 00:47:43,943
that image into QCAD. I’ll just quickly go

54
00:47:43,943 --> 00:47:45,533
through that process now and I’ll be

55
00:47:45,533 --> 00:47:47,933
going through this again later for

56
00:47:47,933 --> 00:47:50,093
both examples. First I’ll take a

57
00:47:50,093 --> 00:47:51,893
screenshot. Make sure it’s the highest resolution

58
00:47:51,893 --> 00:47:53,483
possible and

59
00:47:53,633 --> 00:47:56,753
then be sure to include the

60
00:47:56,753 --> 00:47:58,973
scale in metres, you can just about

61
00:47:58,973 --> 00:48:00,773
see that down in the bottom right-hand corner

62
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:03,053
and save it as a good quality

63
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:07,973
JPEG. Then you measure the pixel length

64
00:48:08,003 --> 00:48:10,793
of the metres scale, so zooming in

65
00:48:10,793 --> 00:48:13,643
here, that’s 5 metres that scale at

66
00:48:13,623 --> 00:48:15,323
the bottom and you can see it’s

67
00:48:15,323 --> 00:48:17,813
106 pixels, so metres

68
00:48:17,813 --> 00:48:20,243
per pixel, 5 metres divided by

69
00:48:20,243 --> 00:48:22,522
106 pixels gives you

70
00:48:22,522 --> 00:48:24,593
0.047 blah de blah de blah

71
00:48:25,084 --> 00:48:27,683
metres per pixel and that is your

72
00:48:27,983 --> 00:48:29,723
call it image scale factor, that’s how

73
00:48:29,723 --> 00:48:31,313
much you need to scale the image down

74
00:48:31,673 --> 00:48:33,953
because when you import an image

75
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:36,953
image into QCAD, it imports it at

76
00:48:36,953 --> 00:48:39,503
1 metre per pixel whereas actually we’ve

77
00:48:39,503 --> 00:48:42,203
got 0.047 metres per

78
00:48:42,203 --> 00:48:44,693
pixel here. So that’s the reason for

79
00:48:44,693 --> 00:48:46,463
scaling it and it’s really really important to

80
00:48:46,463 --> 00:48:48,023
do that otherwise all your

81
00:48:48,233 --> 00:48:49,193
measurements will be out

82
00:48:50,873 --> 00:48:52,583
And then we go into QCAD

83
00:48:52,613 --> 00:48:55,403
`File > Import > Select > Select All`

84
00:48:56,843 --> 00:48:59,033
View the `Property Editor`, so that’s

85
00:48:59,033 --> 00:49:00,173
under the `File` menu and this is

86
00:49:00,173 --> 00:49:02,153
where you're bringing in the image, view

87
00:49:02,153 --> 00:49:03,233
the `Property Editor`

88
00:49:04,793 --> 00:49:06,113
which I’ve actually got locked now on the

89
00:49:06,113 --> 00:49:09,533
right-hand side and you want to put

90
00:49:09,533 --> 00:49:11,153
in the width and the height factor

91
00:49:11,153 --> 00:49:13,253
you can just see down there, there’s

92
00:49:13,253 --> 00:49:14,753
a width factor for the

93
00:49:14,753 --> 00:49:16,673
image and the height factor and

94
00:49:16,733 --> 00:49:20,090
in there we enter that number

95
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,803
0.047 that’s a metre

96
00:49:21,807 --> 00:49:23,903
that’s the image scale factor that’s metres

97
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,593
per pixel

98
00:49:24,593 --> 00:49:27,353
So enter them in there

99
00:49:27,803 --> 00:49:29,213
and then that image gets scaled down

100
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:33,203
Cool, so that’s quite straightforward steps but

101
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:36,143
can be really really useful having that

102
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:38,753
satellite photograph in a CAD plan because

103
00:49:38,753 --> 00:49:41,543
it’s really handy guide to have. Obviously

104
00:49:41,873 --> 00:49:43,583
you want to be, you’ve got got to

105
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:44,753
be aware of there’s copyright issues

106
00:49:44,783 --> 00:49:47,153
you can't use this commercially etc etc

107
00:49:47,243 --> 00:49:49,823
but it’s handy to know how

108
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,533
to do it. Okay so I’m going

109
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:54,353
to jump straight over into creating the

110
00:49:54,383 --> 00:49:58,943
garden acre example. Jump over into QCAD

111
00:49:59,377 --> 00:50:01,313
I’ll quickly show you how to add a

112
00:50:01,313 --> 00:50:03,375
template so the first thing that we

113
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:04,283
need to do is to go to

114
00:50:04,283 --> 00:50:04,913
my GitHub

115
00:50:04,973 --> 00:50:07,643
page github.com/growdigital/template

116
00:50:07,643 --> 00:50:11,333
and download that

117
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:15,023
template, so click on `Code`, `Download ZIP`. Once

118
00:50:15,023 --> 00:50:17,393
that has finished downloading go to your

119
00:50:17,423 --> 00:50:18,653
download folder

120
00:50:20,093 --> 00:50:21,263
and unzip it

121
00:50:22,433 --> 00:50:24,953
unzip it there, I’m going to rename it

122
00:50:24,983 --> 00:50:27,473
template just to keep things tidy

123
00:50:28,673 --> 00:50:31,733
Going to cut that and I have created

124
00:50:31,793 --> 00:50:34,223
in my documents folder I have

125
00:50:34,223 --> 00:50:36,713
created a QCAD folder and that’s

126
00:50:36,713 --> 00:50:39,083
where I’m gonna put my templates so

127
00:50:39,173 --> 00:50:41,843
paste that in there. Now I need

128
00:50:41,843 --> 00:50:43,313
to go back into QCAD

129
00:50:45,173 --> 00:50:49,943
and then under `Edit > Application Preferences > File

130
00:50:50,273 --> 00:50:53,243
and Templates` I need to add that

131
00:50:53,243 --> 00:50:57,443
folder, so go into my Documents folder

132
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:02,153
into QCAD, into template and then

133
00:51:02,183 --> 00:51:04,793
choose that one, click `OK` it says

134
00:51:04,793 --> 00:51:07,043
you need to restart so we will restart

135
00:51:07,043 --> 00:51:07,583
QCAD

136
00:51:08,993 --> 00:51:11,933
and now when you go `File > New

137
00:51:11,933 --> 00:51:12,983
From Template`

138
00:51:14,213 --> 00:51:16,463
you will see that you have the

139
00:51:16,463 --> 00:51:20,603
default folder here, click on `Template`

140
00:51:20,723 --> 00:51:23,273
`Create New Drawing` there we go and

141
00:51:23,273 --> 00:51:26,393
it’s got all the layers in there

142
00:51:26,393 --> 00:51:28,013
as well. So I’m just going to save

143
00:51:28,013 --> 00:51:29,573
that first of all into the garden

144
00:51:29,573 --> 00:51:34,193
acre folder, save as and

145
00:51:34,193 --> 00:51:36,923
and, where are we? We're here so

146
00:51:36,953 --> 00:51:40,313
call that garden-acre and save

147
00:51:40,313 --> 00:51:41,903
that in there. The next thing I

148
00:51:41,903 --> 00:51:43,313
want to do is to bring in

149
00:51:43,373 --> 00:51:46,943
that satellite photograph so I’ve opened up

150
00:51:46,973 --> 00:51:49,583
GNU Image Manipulation Program which is

151
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:52,553
like Photoshop, because I’m on Linux I

152
00:51:52,553 --> 00:51:53,933
don’t have Photoshop anymore

153
00:51:55,313 --> 00:51:57,803
use the marquee tool and I’ll select

154
00:51:57,803 --> 00:52:01,073
that area there and that then gives

155
00:52:01,073 --> 00:52:03,383
me down here, gives us the size

156
00:52:03,383 --> 00:52:05,303
of a 114 so that’s

157
00:52:05,303 --> 00:52:08,513
10 metres divided by a 114

158
00:52:08,513 --> 00:52:12,143
pixels and that’s metres per pixel

159
00:52:12,203 --> 00:52:14,513
so 10 metres divided by 114

160
00:52:14,543 --> 00:52:17,303
is 0.08771…

161
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:19,583
etc so I’ll just

162
00:52:19,673 --> 00:52:22,283
save that number and then I’ll use

163
00:52:22,283 --> 00:52:24,323
that number when I scale down the

164
00:52:24,323 --> 00:52:27,443
image. So go back into CAD, go

165
00:52:27,473 --> 00:52:32,483
`File > Import` garden acre and satellite, so

166
00:52:32,513 --> 00:52:33,593
bring that straight in

167
00:52:36,023 --> 00:52:37,583
oops, okay, and you can see it’s

168
00:52:37,583 --> 00:52:40,163
really really really really really big. What

169
00:52:40,163 --> 00:52:41,363
I want to do is to put

170
00:52:41,363 --> 00:52:43,283
that into the xSatellite layer, so it’s

171
00:52:43,283 --> 00:52:46,373
right at the back, that layer down the bottom

172
00:52:46,373 --> 00:52:48,415
this is the reason

173
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,883
for having layers is that you

174
00:52:49,883 --> 00:52:51,503
can just put different stuff on different

175
00:52:51,503 --> 00:52:53,183
layers and keep it locked up and

176
00:52:53,183 --> 00:52:54,833
tidied away. So now I

177
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:56,633
need to scale this image down

178
00:52:56,663 --> 00:52:58,223
to the right metres per pixel, it’s

179
00:52:58,223 --> 00:52:59,603
being brought in at 1 meter per pixel

180
00:52:59,603 --> 00:53:01,493
and I need it to be much

181
00:53:01,509 --> 00:53:04,073
considerably smaller, so make sure it’s selected

182
00:53:05,723 --> 00:53:07,221
and then I go to that width

183
00:53:07,221 --> 00:53:09,293
factor and the height factor, let me

184
00:53:09,323 --> 00:53:10,643
just pull it over here a little

185
00:53:10,643 --> 00:53:12,983
bit so you can see, so width

186
00:53:12,983 --> 00:53:15,983
factor I’ll place in the metres per

187
00:53:15,983 --> 00:53:19,313
pixel which are calculated from the Photoshop

188
00:53:19,313 --> 00:53:22,343
file and I’ll paste in that number there

189
00:53:22,403 --> 00:53:25,313
and there we go that’s much more

190
00:53:25,313 --> 00:53:30,053
to scale, okay. Another handy little hint

191
00:53:30,323 --> 00:53:31,883
quite often when you bring in new

192
00:53:31,913 --> 00:53:33,983
images and new elements they’ll sit on

193
00:53:33,983 --> 00:53:36,143
top of everything else so if you

194
00:53:36,143 --> 00:53:38,783
go to `Modify` and then the `Draw Order`

195
00:53:38,783 --> 00:53:40,343
you can send it to the

196
00:53:40,343 --> 00:53:41,873
back and that means that you then

197
00:53:41,933 --> 00:53:43,403
get to see other bits and pieces

198
00:53:43,403 --> 00:53:44,993
like the legend I’ve got down here.

199
00:53:45,653 --> 00:53:47,903
So, I’ve created a template, got the

200
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,941
satellite image in and now I’m going to

201
00:53:49,941 --> 00:53:53,153
create the boundary, so back into QCAD

202
00:53:53,183 --> 00:53:55,493
click on the boundary layer because

203
00:53:55,493 --> 00:53:56,241
this is where I’m going to be

204
00:53:56,273 --> 00:53:58,343
drawing the boundary and this is a

205
00:53:58,343 --> 00:54:00,323
lovely house, I just I do like

206
00:54:00,323 --> 00:54:02,923
it, it’s a nice little job

207
00:54:04,403 --> 00:54:06,233
I wanted to do a a water garden

208
00:54:06,623 --> 00:54:09,443
And I’m going to use `Snap Free`

209
00:54:10,223 --> 00:54:11,873
yep, and then I’m using the

210
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:16,163
line tool here and `Snap Free` and

211
00:54:16,163 --> 00:54:17,843
then I’m going to trace an outline

212
00:54:17,843 --> 00:54:19,643
and it’s this field you know this

213
00:54:19,703 --> 00:54:21,413
field here, I’m going

214
00:54:21,413 --> 00:54:22,913
to trace an outline around it. It’s

215
00:54:22,913 --> 00:54:23,813
not going to be particularly

216
00:54:23,873 --> 00:54:26,303
accurate or particularly pretty but just gives

217
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,253
you an idea. I could be

218
00:54:28,253 --> 00:54:30,773
using curves for this as well. I

219
00:54:30,782 --> 00:54:32,333
could be doing it accurately too!

220
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:38,063
There we go and then `Snap Auto` because I

221
00:54:38,063 --> 00:54:39,382
want to snap onto the end of

222
00:54:39,382 --> 00:54:41,421
that bit there okay. There we go

223
00:54:41,453 --> 00:54:43,373
hit escape go back to the arrow

224
00:54:43,373 --> 00:54:46,613
tool. Ah what you can do brilliantly

225
00:54:46,673 --> 00:54:48,473
really nice little feature you can lock

226
00:54:48,473 --> 00:54:50,663
layers so I’m going to lock that satellite layer

227
00:54:51,203 --> 00:54:52,493
and then go back to my boundary layer

228
00:54:52,613 --> 00:54:53,633
This means I don’t pick up

229
00:54:53,693 --> 00:54:56,873
the satellite photo by accident

230
00:54:56,873 --> 00:54:58,733
Now we’ve got that if I

231
00:54:58,733 --> 00:55:00,953
hide, you click on the eye

232
00:55:01,013 --> 00:55:02,783
it hides a layer so I’ll just

233
00:55:02,783 --> 00:55:04,613
hide that layer and you can see

234
00:55:04,643 --> 00:55:06,803
that’s the line that we’ve drawn around

235
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,423
it. So now

236
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:11,273
if I double-click on it, it selects

237
00:55:11,273 --> 00:55:12,382
it, it gives you the

238
00:55:12,382 --> 00:55:15,353
total length here but it doesn't

239
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:18,623
give you the area so what I’m

240
00:55:18,623 --> 00:55:19,823
going to do is make it into

241
00:55:19,823 --> 00:55:21,533
a polyline which is what I showed you

242
00:55:21,533 --> 00:55:23,603
earlier on so double-click

243
00:55:25,043 --> 00:55:30,323
selects all the items, `Draw > Polyline >

244
00:55:30,323 --> 00:55:31,673
Polyline From Selection`

245
00:55:33,743 --> 00:55:35,483
And now when I click on it

246
00:55:35,923 --> 00:55:38,003
it gives us an area so that’s

247
00:55:38,003 --> 00:55:40,643
3,127m²

248
00:55:40,643 --> 00:55:42,653
so basically that’s three quarters of an

249
00:55:42,653 --> 00:55:45,113
acre which is a fair sized, nice

250
00:55:45,143 --> 00:55:46,103
sized garden

251
00:55:48,203 --> 00:55:49,553
I’ll bring the satellite back so we

252
00:55:49,553 --> 00:55:51,473
can see. So next I’m going to

253
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,613
put some paths in

254
00:55:54,113 --> 00:55:56,993
and I’ll just do this on

255
00:55:56,993 --> 00:55:58,852
the areas. I’m just going to use

256
00:55:58,853 --> 00:56:00,080
a line tool, I’m not

257
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:02,349
going do anything really fancy, so line tool

258
00:56:03,653 --> 00:56:05,633
this one here and I know that

259
00:56:05,633 --> 00:56:08,513
there’s an entrance here, I’ll snap onto

260
00:56:08,513 --> 00:56:10,607
the entity so that I know that

261
00:56:10,607 --> 00:56:13,133
it snaps actually onto that line, I think

262
00:56:13,133 --> 00:56:15,046
the path is around about there and

263
00:56:15,067 --> 00:56:20,093
I go `Snap Auto` turns it off and

264
00:56:20,213 --> 00:56:21,503
I think they want a

265
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,243
path going around here

266
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:24,843
round the top

267
00:56:27,603 --> 00:56:29,583
and there’s another exit out there, so

268
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:32,853
`Snap onto Entity` to snap up to

269
00:56:32,859 --> 00:56:34,113
there, there we go

270
00:56:35,343 --> 00:56:37,893
We now have a path going around

271
00:56:37,893 --> 00:56:39,720
the edge. Turn off the satellite so

272
00:56:39,753 --> 00:56:41,133
you can see the path. What I

273
00:56:41,133 --> 00:56:44,103
will do is to offset this so

274
00:56:44,103 --> 00:56:45,453
you get much more the idea of

275
00:56:45,453 --> 00:56:47,343
a path, so using the offset tool

276
00:56:47,643 --> 00:56:49,233
you can draw one line for your

277
00:56:49,233 --> 00:56:51,093
path and then you can offset it

278
00:56:51,393 --> 00:56:54,573
both sides or one side and

279
00:56:54,573 --> 00:56:55,293
then it creates

280
00:56:55,293 --> 00:56:57,367
the path itself but the size of

281
00:56:57,367 --> 00:56:58,683
your path depends on how wide

282
00:56:58,683 --> 00:57:00,213
you want it but if it’s about

283
00:57:00,243 --> 00:57:02,793
a metre, a metre’s a nice big comfortable path

284
00:57:03,033 --> 00:57:04,473
down to about 0.4 metres

285
00:57:04,503 --> 00:57:05,943
for a single person to walk along

286
00:57:05,973 --> 00:57:07,173
so it depends where the path is and

287
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:11,103
how you’re using it and so let’s hit escape

288
00:57:12,123 --> 00:57:15,456
go into the modification tools and then offset

289
00:57:15,963 --> 00:57:18,843
and I’ll offset 0.3 metres

290
00:57:18,903 --> 00:57:20,583
on each side I’ll just zoom in

291
00:57:21,303 --> 00:57:23,883
so offset it on that side and

292
00:57:23,883 --> 00:57:27,213
offset it on that side, okay and

293
00:57:27,213 --> 00:57:29,373
then I’m going to delete the middle

294
00:57:29,373 --> 00:57:30,483
bit. And then you’ve got a nice

295
00:57:30,483 --> 00:57:32,643
little path. Now you could do this using

296
00:57:32,643 --> 00:57:34,563
the NURBS tool as well. Then next

297
00:57:34,563 --> 00:57:35,553
up, I want to

298
00:57:35,613 --> 00:57:37,923
put the trees in so let’s go

299
00:57:37,953 --> 00:57:40,803
and grab some trees from the forest

300
00:57:40,803 --> 00:57:43,773
garden blocks. Go back up here, blocks

301
00:57:43,773 --> 00:57:48,303
forest garden canopy and let’s get a selection

302
00:57:48,303 --> 00:57:52,353
of trees. Cornus capitata, Cornel…

303
00:57:52,413 --> 00:57:55,443
Cornus capitata, click that button there

304
00:57:56,103 --> 00:57:59,793
check that one Bentham's Cornel, Cornus kousa

305
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:03,633
just escape that, Cornus kousa, click on

306
00:58:03,633 --> 00:58:07,773
the insert block button, it’s a Chinese Dogwood

307
00:58:08,643 --> 00:58:10,743
I’ve got to have a hawthorn

308
00:58:12,783 --> 00:58:14,763
Crataegus schraderiana

309
00:58:17,553 --> 00:58:19,923
insert block, Blue Hawthorn

310
00:58:21,033 --> 00:58:23,613
and then I always always always have to

311
00:58:23,613 --> 00:58:25,503
have a Sweet Chestnut, actually a Sweet

312
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:28,173
Chestnut won't work because I know it’s

313
00:58:28,173 --> 00:58:30,453
a damp, oh I’ll put a Sweet Chestnut on anyway

314
00:58:31,203 --> 00:58:33,053
let’s pretend it’s not damp there, Sweet

315
00:58:33,053 --> 00:58:35,223
Chestnuts don’t like heavy clay soils

316
00:58:35,283 --> 00:58:36,123
and I know it’s a heavy

317
00:58:36,123 --> 00:58:37,353
clay soil there so it won't do

318
00:58:37,353 --> 00:58:39,363
very well. I’ll just cut them

319
00:58:41,583 --> 00:58:43,263
and I’ll go over to the tree

320
00:58:43,263 --> 00:58:47,013
layer in the `Layers List` and

321
00:58:47,013 --> 00:58:50,193
then paste and there we go, look

322
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,413
at that, fantastic and then you move the

323
00:58:52,413 --> 00:58:53,883
trees around so that they’re in

324
00:58:53,943 --> 00:58:56,493
the right position

325
00:58:56,493 --> 00:58:58,623
they've got enough spacing and there’s enough

326
00:58:58,653 --> 00:59:00,573
there’s enough spacing around between

327
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:02,073
the trees and enough light getting through

328
00:59:02,073 --> 00:59:04,563
to the bottom canopy floor layer

329
00:59:06,873 --> 00:59:09,903
Okay now I’m going to put

330
00:59:09,903 --> 00:59:13,923
in some hedgerows, some hedges so let’s

331
00:59:13,953 --> 00:59:14,823
open up

332
00:59:16,143 --> 00:59:18,873
the shrub document from the forest garden

333
00:59:18,873 --> 00:59:19,563
plants

334
00:59:21,753 --> 00:59:23,493
and we’ll have a hedge of

335
00:59:25,983 --> 00:59:28,983
Ligustrum vulgare

336
00:59:30,843 --> 00:59:32,763
this is a Wild Privet really really

337
00:59:32,763 --> 00:59:35,996
good wildlife plant, Privet, Ligustrum vulgare

338
00:59:38,133 --> 00:59:39,423
and we go back here and paste

339
00:59:39,423 --> 00:59:39,783
it in

340
00:59:40,923 --> 00:59:44,163
and this forms part of the

341
00:59:44,403 --> 00:59:47,583
design side of things is what

342
00:59:47,613 --> 00:59:50,163
height windbreak you should have

343
00:59:50,163 --> 00:59:51,633
So on the northside you can see, down

344
00:59:51,633 --> 00:59:53,643
here you’ve got north-east-west and

345
00:59:53,643 --> 00:59:55,533
south, on the north side you want

346
00:59:55,533 --> 00:59:58,770
the tallest wind breaks along there and

347
00:59:58,893 --> 01:00:01,053
also because that is a road

348
01:00:01,053 --> 01:00:02,793
there as well you want a

349
01:00:03,153 --> 01:00:05,013
big tall I would have put a

350
01:00:05,043 --> 01:00:07,683
double thickness windbreak along there, you're

351
01:00:07,683 --> 01:00:09,543
not going to lose any light, you

352
01:00:09,543 --> 01:00:11,013
get much more protection and you make

353
01:00:11,013 --> 01:00:13,653
it thick and right cut down on

354
01:00:13,653 --> 01:00:14,883
the amount of road noise that you

355
01:00:14,883 --> 01:00:18,243
get. So Ligustrum vulgare is actually

356
01:00:18,243 --> 01:00:19,711
not that tall so I wouldn't have

357
01:00:19,893 --> 01:00:21,213
it, 1.5 metres

358
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:22,473
I thought it would be bigger

359
01:00:22,473 --> 01:00:24,273
than that, to 1.5 to

360
01:00:24,303 --> 01:00:25,143
2 metres

361
01:00:26,943 --> 01:00:28,293
so that’s a kind of hedge you'd

362
01:00:28,293 --> 01:00:30,123
have on the south side. So the

363
01:00:30,123 --> 01:00:33,003
most valuable sunlight comes from the south

364
01:00:33,003 --> 01:00:35,463
and the west that the air has

365
01:00:35,463 --> 01:00:36,693
had a time to warm up in

366
01:00:36,693 --> 01:00:38,913
the afternoon so that the afternoon

367
01:00:38,913 --> 01:00:41,703
sunlight is more valuable, there’s more photosynthesis

368
01:00:41,703 --> 01:00:43,083
apparently than in the

369
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:44,943
morning. I want to put them onto the

370
01:00:44,943 --> 01:00:45,693
shrub layer

371
01:00:46,413 --> 01:00:47,343
I put one there

372
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:49,833
and then one there

373
01:00:52,683 --> 01:00:53,403
okay

374
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:00,633
And then to make it a windbreak

375
01:01:00,633 --> 01:01:02,463
hedge all that I do

376
01:01:04,683 --> 01:01:05,943
it’s three metres diameter

377
01:01:07,053 --> 01:01:08,403
all that I’m going do now is

378
01:01:08,403 --> 01:01:11,733
to draw a line between them, right

379
01:01:11,733 --> 01:01:13,323
in the centre, the central points, it

380
01:01:13,323 --> 01:01:15,543
should automatically snap to the reference point

381
01:01:15,543 --> 01:01:16,383
which is in the middle

382
01:01:17,763 --> 01:01:22,227
from one to the other. Hit escape and

383
01:01:22,227 --> 01:01:23,523
now I’m going to use the offset

384
01:01:23,523 --> 01:01:25,383
tool to put the two sides of

385
01:01:25,383 --> 01:01:27,363
the hedge on. So the same

386
01:01:27,363 --> 01:01:29,403
kind of principle as creating a path

387
01:01:29,673 --> 01:01:33,453
so modification tools, offset tool and I

388
01:01:33,453 --> 01:01:35,613
know that the width of the Privet

389
01:01:35,613 --> 01:01:37,773
hedge will be 3 metres diameter

390
01:01:37,773 --> 01:01:40,113
or 3 metres width, so it’s

391
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,033
1.5 metres for one side

392
01:01:42,033 --> 01:01:43,743
1.5 metres for the other side

393
01:01:44,733 --> 01:01:46,623
So a distance 1.5

394
01:01:49,323 --> 01:01:50,913
bomp and that one bomp

395
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:54,333
Delete the middle one now

396
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:55,953
There you go, we now have

397
01:01:57,153 --> 01:01:58,503
a windbreak. And then I would

398
01:01:58,503 --> 01:02:01,143
do wind breaks around the

399
01:02:01,143 --> 01:02:03,273
edges. A big part of the design

400
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:05,523
is figuring out how the different areas

401
01:02:05,523 --> 01:02:07,563
are going to be used and a

402
01:02:07,563 --> 01:02:09,243
fundamental element of that design which I

403
01:02:09,273 --> 01:02:13,683
cover in my design class is creating

404
01:02:13,743 --> 01:02:16,203
the areas through the use of paths

405
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:17,133
So you create

406
01:02:17,184 --> 01:02:19,233
the paths first, you create the structure

407
01:02:19,233 --> 01:02:21,333
of the garden first of all and

408
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:22,863
then you can bring in the different

409
01:02:22,863 --> 01:02:24,933
planting around and the features around that

410
01:02:26,373 --> 01:02:28,803
okay so what I would do

411
01:02:29,553 --> 01:02:31,443
after this I would create

412
01:02:31,473 --> 01:02:33,393
different windbreaks all the way around so

413
01:02:33,393 --> 01:02:34,653
you would always want to have

414
01:02:34,653 --> 01:02:36,843
windbreaks surrounding your garden to reduce

415
01:02:36,843 --> 01:02:38,883
the amount of turbulence particularly with

416
01:02:38,883 --> 01:02:41,313
the Climate Emergency because there’s going to

417
01:02:41,313 --> 01:02:42,993
be more and more extreme weather events

418
01:02:44,414 --> 01:02:45,813
There we go and that’s that

419
01:02:45,813 --> 01:02:48,723
one done. And now onto creating the

420
01:02:48,753 --> 01:02:50,043
garden town

421
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:53,013
So as I said before, the satellite

422
01:02:53,013 --> 01:02:54,603
really is just a rough guide. I’ll

423
01:02:54,633 --> 01:02:56,433
do it from the satellite now but what

424
01:02:56,433 --> 01:02:57,543
you want to be doing is creating

425
01:02:57,543 --> 01:02:59,223
your plan from actual measurements on the

426
01:02:59,223 --> 01:03:02,163
ground and just get general information from

427
01:03:02,163 --> 01:03:03,715
the maps, okay, so this is what

428
01:03:03,715 --> 01:03:05,853
we're going to be doing so let’s go

429
01:03:05,853 --> 01:03:08,073
and create a new file, save that

430
01:03:08,073 --> 01:03:10,563
one, create a new file from template

431
01:03:12,363 --> 01:03:14,553
And I’m going to save that as garden

432
01:03:14,613 --> 01:03:18,513
town, okay, go up the level, garden town

433
01:03:18,543 --> 01:03:20,883
and this is garden town,

434
01:03:20,883 --> 01:03:21,363
garden-town

435
01:03:23,343 --> 01:03:26,313
great stuff then go over to

436
01:03:26,343 --> 01:03:30,093
my image bitmap editor, zoom down

437
01:03:30,093 --> 01:03:30,603
here

438
01:03:31,923 --> 01:03:35,913
Use a rectangular marquee tool and select that

439
01:03:38,163 --> 01:03:39,393
and you can see that the width

440
01:03:39,393 --> 01:03:40,983
the marquee is a 110 pixels

441
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:44,553
so that is 5 metres and

442
01:03:44,553 --> 01:03:46,233
110 pixels that’s

443
01:03:46,263 --> 01:03:48,813
5 divided by 110 gives

444
01:03:48,813 --> 01:03:51,093
you your metres per pixel, so

445
01:03:52,803 --> 01:03:55,413
5 divided by 110

446
01:03:55,773 --> 01:03:56,523
gives you that.

447
01:03:57,693 --> 01:04:00,993
Lovely. And now go back into QCAD

448
01:04:01,623 --> 01:04:08,373
select the satellite layer, file import and

449
01:04:09,123 --> 01:04:10,113
it’s going to make me go all the

450
01:04:10,113 --> 01:04:11,433
way back obviously

451
01:04:12,783 --> 01:04:15,363
examples, garden town, satellite

452
01:04:17,133 --> 01:04:17,913
pop that in there

453
01:04:19,743 --> 01:04:21,333
See, really really really big it is

454
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:24,390
Let’s select it and then the width

455
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:26,973
factor, whoops, I’ll just pop that up here

456
01:04:26,973 --> 01:04:27,393
for you

457
01:04:29,043 --> 01:04:31,413
that’s the width factor here, so paste

458
01:04:31,413 --> 01:04:32,943
in that value which is the metres

459
01:04:32,943 --> 01:04:34,833
per pixel, paste that value in there

460
01:04:35,643 --> 01:04:37,563
and you can see it shrinks right the

461
01:04:37,563 --> 01:04:40,353
way down, weeee, that’s better, and now

462
01:04:40,353 --> 01:04:42,573
it’s to scale and then just to

463
01:04:42,573 --> 01:04:43,683
get it, can you see

464
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:49,413
`Modify > Draw Order > Send to Back`

465
01:04:50,537 --> 01:04:51,783
and then you can see

466
01:04:51,783 --> 01:04:51,993
the

467
01:04:53,913 --> 01:04:56,853
compass, the legend there as well lovely

468
01:04:56,853 --> 01:04:57,783
I’ll lock that layer

469
01:04:59,403 --> 01:05:01,683
So this is a friend's garden in

470
01:05:01,923 --> 01:05:04,143
North London, I worked on a few

471
01:05:04,143 --> 01:05:04,863
years ago now

472
01:05:06,633 --> 01:05:08,583
okay, going to pop the `Property Editor`

473
01:05:08,583 --> 01:05:10,983
there and it’s this one here, so

474
01:05:10,983 --> 01:05:12,243
I’m just going to do this really

475
01:05:12,243 --> 01:05:15,333
really really basically so start off with

476
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:18,963
the boundary so select the boundary layer

477
01:05:20,073 --> 01:05:22,593
click on the line tool, this one

478
01:05:22,593 --> 01:05:24,213
the only one I ever use

479
01:05:24,225 --> 01:05:27,123
`LI` and then we’ll just click

480
01:05:27,693 --> 01:05:34,173
click, click, click, click, and that’s it

481
01:05:34,953 --> 01:05:36,393
double-click it and you can see

482
01:05:36,393 --> 01:05:37,953
if I just turn off the satellite

483
01:05:39,003 --> 01:05:40,983
that’s it, it’s a bit rough and ready

484
01:05:41,343 --> 01:05:44,253
double-click it and then we’ll turn

485
01:05:44,253 --> 01:05:46,593
that into a polyline and then we

486
01:05:46,593 --> 01:05:48,933
can see how big it is, so

487
01:05:48,963 --> 01:05:50,883
`Draw Polyline From Selection`

488
01:05:52,203 --> 01:05:54,783
and that gives me an area of

489
01:05:54,783 --> 01:05:57,723
102 metres, so that’s

490
01:05:57,723 --> 01:05:59,163
how big their garden is

491
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:00,513
so it’s a bit under the

492
01:06:00,753 --> 01:06:03,753
average, the average for a UK London garden

493
01:06:03,783 --> 01:06:06,723
is a 140 square metres

494
01:06:06,753 --> 01:06:08,493
and theirs comes in at just over

495
01:06:08,493 --> 01:06:12,093
100 square metres okay

496
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:14,403
so then what I would do is

497
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:15,783
to put the path in

498
01:06:17,313 --> 01:06:20,553
in areas and this is where sometimes

499
01:06:20,553 --> 01:06:21,603
you want to change the colours of

500
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:22,953
your layers so you can actually see

501
01:06:22,953 --> 01:06:23,943
what's going on, as you can see

502
01:06:23,943 --> 01:06:25,323
from this you can hardly,

503
01:06:25,323 --> 01:06:27,033
you can't actually see the red

504
01:06:27,453 --> 01:06:29,283
on that boundary on this particular image

505
01:06:29,433 --> 01:06:31,263
so this is where you would play

506
01:06:31,263 --> 01:06:33,183
around with the different colours, so we’ll get

507
01:06:33,183 --> 01:06:35,433
the, ah the kitchen door is around

508
01:06:35,433 --> 01:06:36,273
about here somewhere

509
01:06:37,708 --> 01:06:38,908
and say oh we want a new

510
01:06:38,908 --> 01:06:40,708
path and that path goes up to

511
01:06:40,708 --> 01:06:41,008
here

512
01:06:42,058 --> 01:06:42,838
up to the shed

513
01:06:44,968 --> 01:06:45,538
okay

514
01:06:47,188 --> 01:06:49,198
let’s just turn off that satellite

515
01:06:49,198 --> 01:06:50,128
so you can see what's going on

516
01:06:50,128 --> 01:06:51,148
so that’s my path

517
01:06:53,428 --> 01:06:54,748
I’ll make it into a polyline so it’s

518
01:06:54,748 --> 01:06:58,048
easier to use so `Draw > Polyline

519
01:06:58,048 --> 01:07:00,868
Polyline From Selection` and that sets it as

520
01:07:00,881 --> 01:07:01,318
a group

521
01:07:03,598 --> 01:07:04,138
and then

522
01:07:06,118 --> 01:07:07,438
oh let’s go and put the the

523
01:07:07,438 --> 01:07:08,968
shed in, there’s a shed down here

524
01:07:08,968 --> 01:07:11,728
in the bottom left-hand corner so

525
01:07:13,108 --> 01:07:14,818
I’ll go into my shape tools

526
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:17,608
and I’ll just draw it freehand

527
01:07:19,318 --> 01:07:23,008
so `Snap Free` so it

528
01:07:23,008 --> 01:07:25,708
doesn't snap onto anything else

529
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:30,628
I’ll do that there, there we go I’ve

530
01:07:30,628 --> 01:07:32,608
gone and drawn it into the

531
01:07:32,608 --> 01:07:36,868
areas layer, so how you move

532
01:07:36,868 --> 01:07:39,028
it in the `Property Editor` is to

533
01:07:39,028 --> 01:07:40,708
select the thing that you want

534
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:43,408
to move and then change the

535
01:07:44,548 --> 01:07:45,838
the layer that it’s in. I

536
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:47,098
want to put it into the Structures

537
01:07:47,098 --> 01:07:48,568
layer and there you will see, it will

538
01:07:48,578 --> 01:07:50,818
automatically change colour down here, we just

539
01:07:50,818 --> 01:07:52,198
turn off the satellite so you can

540
01:07:52,198 --> 01:07:55,318
see, okay? Double-click it, I’ll turn it

541
01:07:55,318 --> 01:07:58,018
into a block actually `Create Block

542
01:07:58,018 --> 01:07:58,708
From Selection`

543
01:08:01,078 --> 01:08:03,388
Okay and I’m going to call that shed and

544
01:08:03,388 --> 01:08:04,078
then you’ll see

545
01:08:07,798 --> 01:08:10,678
the shed will appear here in the

546
01:08:10,678 --> 01:08:12,328
`Block List`, okay?

547
01:08:15,808 --> 01:08:17,968
And then it’s the same principle now

548
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:20,398
as well for putting in trees and

549
01:08:20,428 --> 01:08:23,098
shrubs I’ve got my forest

550
01:08:23,098 --> 01:08:24,988
garden plants blocks here, I’ll put up

551
01:08:25,078 --> 01:08:29,008
a hazel down here, Corylus avellana so

552
01:08:29,008 --> 01:08:30,718
the big name’s the common name

553
01:08:31,048 --> 01:08:33,627
and then the botanical name’s underneath

554
01:08:34,258 --> 01:08:35,787
and the botanical names is

555
01:08:35,787 --> 01:08:37,108
in the list, in the `Layer List`

556
01:08:37,287 --> 01:08:38,308
so let’s cut that

557
01:08:39,598 --> 01:08:42,328
go over to the garden town go

558
01:08:42,328 --> 01:08:43,287
to shrub

559
01:08:45,358 --> 01:08:47,728
paste it in there, wow, much much

560
01:08:47,728 --> 01:08:50,768
bigger it’s a town garden so the

561
01:08:51,508 --> 01:08:54,118
trees obviously much larger size, so there

562
01:08:54,118 --> 01:08:55,078
we go and then you can do

563
01:08:55,078 --> 01:08:57,898
that with individual beds with the paths

564
01:08:58,048 --> 01:09:00,688
putting plants in, putting different features in

565
01:09:01,678 --> 01:09:04,587
greenhouses, patios, all that kind

566
01:09:04,587 --> 01:09:06,148
of stuff, then you start to build

567
01:09:06,148 --> 01:09:08,037
up the design for the garden but

568
01:09:08,037 --> 01:09:10,198
as I said before, the most important

569
01:09:10,198 --> 01:09:12,718
thing when you're creating these designs is

570
01:09:12,718 --> 01:09:15,417
to get the spacing right between the

571
01:09:15,868 --> 01:09:17,818
trees, make sure that they've

572
01:09:17,818 --> 01:09:19,377
got the paths in the right

573
01:09:19,377 --> 01:09:21,898
place, so getting the structure in the

574
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:24,568
The smaller planting is much much easier

575
01:09:24,568 --> 01:09:24,747
to do

576
01:09:24,747 --> 01:09:26,488
on-site so you don’t have

577
01:09:26,488 --> 01:09:28,198
to be so precise about

578
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:30,298
the designs for them but

579
01:09:30,298 --> 01:09:32,247
it’s really really important to get the

580
01:09:32,247 --> 01:09:34,287
trees and the paths and the main

581
01:09:34,287 --> 01:09:37,078
structures in place first. And that brings us

582
01:09:37,078 --> 01:09:39,654
to a close and what I also have

583
01:09:40,648 --> 01:09:44,127
a whole load of resources, so there’s the

584
01:09:44,127 --> 01:09:44,908
link for downloading

585
01:09:44,908 --> 01:09:46,917
QCAD, they've got the CAD files

586
01:09:46,917 --> 01:09:50,457
for this class, I’ve also created

587
01:09:50,488 --> 01:09:53,654
a public Telegram group called Garden Wild Edible

588
01:09:53,658 --> 01:09:55,558
which goes along with these classes

589
01:09:55,798 --> 01:09:57,298
and that’s a space if you want

590
01:09:57,298 --> 01:10:00,208
to ask any questions, then feel free

591
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:01,841
to join and then ask questions

592
01:10:01,821 --> 01:10:03,688
if you’ve got any questions about QCAD

593
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:05,068
kind of technical

594
01:10:05,068 --> 01:10:06,748
stuff then there’s a QCAD

595
01:10:06,748 --> 01:10:09,328
link to QCAD forum, there’s my template

596
01:10:09,328 --> 01:10:12,778
my delicious CAD template file

597
01:10:12,778 --> 01:10:15,178
native plants spreadsheet which I haven't shown

598
01:10:15,178 --> 01:10:16,348
you which I ought to show you

599
01:10:16,648 --> 01:10:20,518
and the forest garden spreadsheet

600
01:10:20,518 --> 01:10:22,738
I will be using these more

601
01:10:22,738 --> 01:10:25,195
in the design section of

602
01:10:25,228 --> 01:10:27,928
the classes. So the Garden Wild Spreadsheet

603
01:10:27,958 --> 01:10:30,238
is a list of native plants, it’s

604
01:10:30,238 --> 01:10:31,858
flowers just at the moment, I’ve got

605
01:10:31,948 --> 01:10:36,058
space for other native forms but the

606
01:10:36,088 --> 01:10:37,888
Forest Garden Spreadsheet is a list of

607
01:10:37,888 --> 01:10:39,538
all the forest garden plants in

608
01:10:39,539 --> 01:10:41,368
Martin Crawford's book as well so loads and

609
01:10:41,368 --> 01:10:43,888
loads of information there and then you’ve

610
01:10:43,888 --> 01:10:45,388
got my CAD blocks too

611
01:10:45,388 --> 01:10:47,038
That draws us to an end

612
01:10:47,038 --> 01:10:49,258
I hope that’s useful, if you do want

613
01:10:49,258 --> 01:10:50,548
to get in touch with me, my

614
01:10:50,548 --> 01:10:52,498
email address is here
