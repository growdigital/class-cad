00:00:00,366 --> 00:00:02,256
Greetings and welcome back to the second

2
00:00:02,266 --> 00:00:04,396
part of my online class ‘CAD for

3
00:00:04,366 --> 00:00:06,166
Gardeners’ and here I’m going to be

4
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:09,436
talking about setting up QCAD, now QCAD

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,179
is my most favourite piece of CAD

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,630
software, it’s absolutely brilliant and the free

7
00:00:13,633 --> 00:00:16,393
version is more than adequate for any

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,580
kind of CAD garden design. It can

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:19,821
be a

10
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,250
little bit fiddly to be honest though

11
00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:23,476
to get the free version and to

12
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:24,732
get rid of the trial

13
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,233
You have to download the QCAD

14
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:29,326
trial and there’s a few steps involved

15
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,110
in doing this. But I want

16
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,720
to get this right, so that you’ve

17
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:34,563
got some reference and you’ve got

18
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:36,666
a CAD environment that you’re happy with

19
00:00:37,366 --> 00:00:39,346
So let’s get cracking with this. Press

20
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:40,056
the `P` key

21
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,446
and it brings up the notes and, as

22
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:42,603
you can see, there’s quite a few

23
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,469
notes here. There are seven different steps

24
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:51,886
and the first one is to install

25
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,150
QCAD. You need to download it, go

26
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,536
to QCAD.org and download

27
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:58,543
it. There’s three different versions — for Windows

28
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:01,266
Mac and Linux — and download the appropriate

29
00:01:01,266 --> 00:01:03,336
version for your operating system and for

30
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,033
your computer. And then you need to

31
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,353
install it. Again

32
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:09,496
go to QCAD.org, in the

33
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,610
documentation there’s an installation guide for Windows

34
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:16,123
Mac and Linux and, yeah, I won’t

35
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,570
go into the details because that really

36
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:18,436
would be a bit dull

37
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:21,333
but there we have it. So, get

38
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:22,173
cracking with that

39
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:25,943
Once you’ve installed it on your computer

40
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:29,606
let’s start it up. So, we’re going to

41
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:32,484
set the units to metres

42
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,552
that’s going to be the first job

43
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,430
So, double-click to start and then

44
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:40,273
go to unit and metre and click

45
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,416
`OK`. Now, I use metres because

46
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,840
I’m in the UK and

47
00:01:44,866 --> 00:01:47,896
metres are a really good unit to use

48
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:50,356
because they're approximate enough for gardening

49
00:01:50,366 --> 00:01:51,296
and they don’t have to be super

50
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,130
super accurate and are not like millimetres

51
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:57,063
for architecture or micrometres for manufacturing

52
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,049
So it really depends though where you

53
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:00,173
are in the world as to what

54
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,899
units you’ll be using. But something like

55
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,559
metres is great

56
00:02:03,566 --> 00:02:05,576
So the first thing that we

57
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:07,516
need to do is to remove the

58
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:10,113
trial plugins and this is the most

59
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:13,133
painful part and the dullest bit

60
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,556
*but* it is kind of necessary. I’ve

61
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:17,603
listed them here so you

62
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,129
need to find out where your plugins

63
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:21,233
folder is and the plugins folder

64
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:23,543
obviously it depends which operating system

65
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:23,716
you’re

66
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:25,533
working on. I’ll show you where

67
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:28,233
the plugins are on here

68
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:30,353
and if we go, I know that

69
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:32,556
QCAD on linux is installed in

70
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:35,776
the `opt` folder, double-click on that, go in

71
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:36,636
to QCAD

72
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,006
and then there’s the plugins there and

73
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:41,563
I’ll view them as a

74
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:43,846
list, makes it easier to delete

75
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:45,936
them, so the list view. Basically, you want

76
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,063
to delete all of the

77
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:50,946
plugins apart from these three here, so

78
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:52,883
the easiest thing is to

79
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:56,143
select all the plugins and then deselect

80
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:57,826
`libqcaddarkstyle`

81
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,433
`libqcaddxf`

82
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:03,933
and `libqcadscripts`

83
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,067
Select all the plugins

84
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,519
like so, and then control-click

85
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:14,501
`libqcaddarkstyle`, `libqcaddxf`

86
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,449
and `libqcadscripts`. I’m going to

87
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:19,146
send the rest of the stuff to

88
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:22,013
the wastebasket. And then we go back

89
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:24,523
into CAD and then in the widget

90
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,660
on the side there’s a little button that says `Remove`

91
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,328
click on `Remove`

92
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,014
“To remove this add-on please

93
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,740
delete the following plugins” and you go

94
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:33,766
“Yep, already done it.” The next step

95
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,599
that I want to do is to

96
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,000
set the theme to dark and the

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,279
background to dark grey. And the reason

98
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,030
for doing this is that I find

99
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:45,586
an awful lot easier with the range

100
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:47,486
of standard colours in

101
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,869
QCAD to work on a dark background —

102
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:51,576
they show up much more easily

103
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:56,016
So go into CAD, click on `Application

104
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,019
Preferences`, scroll down to `Theme`

105
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:05,114
and then choose `Dark`. Click `OK`, it’ll

106
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,052
say you need to restart QCAD

107
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,566
So go `OK`, quit out of

108
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,970
QCAD and let’s restart it. And here

109
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:13,886
we go, a nice dark theme to

110
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,180
QCAD. One last thing I want to

111
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,786
do with the colours is to change the

112
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,270
background because I find that black a

113
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:21,216
bit too much, a bit too intense

114
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:23,800
a bit too doom and gloom. So

115
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:27,433
go to `Application Preferences` and then if

116
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,103
you look under `Graphics View` down here

117
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:32,773
`Colors` and then

118
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,273
`Background` and I’m going to set the

119
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,160
background to `Others…` and I’m going to

120
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,356
give it a grey color. And the

121
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:40,806
colour that I use, you can use

122
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,359
whatever grey, you know, you can

123
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,106
choose a colour from here, the one

124
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,830
that I use as a standard is

125
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:49,566
3e3e3e, that’s a nice

126
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,309
combination of nice calming grey. And the

127
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,263
final couple of things we’re going to

128
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:53,926
do is

129
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:56,186
to play around with the widgets

130
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,299
I want to hide the `Command Line` widget

131
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,160
at the bottom and then show

132
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,146
the `Block List`, so if you go

133
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:05,133
to the `View` menu and then the

134
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:09,576
`Command Line` there, gets rid of it

135
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:11,546
at the bottom, and then the `View`

136
00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:13,966
menu and the `Block List` and it

137
00:05:13,966 --> 00:05:14,146
brings

138
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,190
up your `Block List`

139
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,853
And then finally, finally, what I like

140
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,683
to do is to stack the `Layer`

141
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:24,776
`Property` and `Block` widgets. So these are

142
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:26,296
the widgets, there’s the `Layer` and the

143
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,313
`Block`. I put the `Layer` on first

144
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,799
and the reason for this is, this

145
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,690
is the widget I use

146
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,989
the most, so it’s always kind of

147
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,557
very handy to see which layer you’re

148
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:36,256
working on

149
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:39,136
And then I’ll pop in the `Property

150
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:42,826
Editor`, the `Property Editor` widget in

151
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,530
the middle, and that always has a

152
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:47,903
lot of useful information in. And the

153
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,519
one I use the least is the

154
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:51,336
`Block List`, that goes at the bottom

155
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,786
And there we have it, we’re all set

156
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,389
up and ready to rock 🤘
