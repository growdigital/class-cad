00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,950
Greetings and welcome, my name is Jake

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,930
Rayson, I am a wildlife and food

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,090
forest garden designer and welcome to my

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,390
online class ‘CAD for Gardeners’, this is

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,250
a beginner's guide so this is aimed

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,380
at beginners but also people who are keen

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,830
to get cracking really quickly with using

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,470
computer aided design for their garden creations

9
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,440
A couple of notes before we get started. First

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,600
of all this slideshow is always available

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,333
online natureworks.org.uk/class/cad

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,120
If you press the key `P` on

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,950
your keyboard, it brings up all the

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,050
notes and there’s some interesting links and

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,640
extra information in there as well

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,030
So without further ado let’s get cracking

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,630
An outline for today - why CAD?

18
00:00:45,632 --> 00:00:46,950
why would you bother using CAD in

19
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,720
the first place? Indeed, why would you

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,390
bother planning in the first place? And

21
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,430
then I’m going to look at setting

22
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,290
up QCAD and QCAD is the

23
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,410
software that I use for CAD designs

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,977
Going through step by step

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,800
how to set it up so that it

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,790
all works nicely

27
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,390
The third section is looking at shapes

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,910
entities and mods. Basically the simple

29
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,100
shapes, there’s four simple shapes that if you

30
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,980
learn, you can create an infinite variety

31
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,830
of shapes by combining them, and using

32
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,060
entities to rotate stuff, and modifications to

33
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,520
alter all these different elements as well

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,000
So we’ll be

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,460
learning four basic shapes, three types of

36
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,780
entity and four modifications. And then finally

37
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,720
I’ll be looking at two examples, a

38
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,750
one acre garden and a town

39
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,880
garden and I’ll be walking through

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,700
step-by-step how to create them.

41
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,630
So why CAD?

42
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,560
A very good question! A bit of background first

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,440
of all. There is, as you might

44
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,630
well be aware, a Nature and Climate

45
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,990
Emergency and gardens need to be a

46
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,830
wildlife haven with crops, with edible crops

47
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,570
I will give you a definition of

48
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,760
what a forest garden is because that’s my

49
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,840
gardening background

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,180
But I think in general terms

51
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,250
this world needs more gardeners and it

52
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,560
needs more gardeners who are aware of

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,810
the issues surrounding the Nature and

54
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,350
the Climate Emergency, so changing conditions and

55
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,440
a massive, massive, massive decrease in the

56
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,720
in the number of species. This is

57
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,970
why we need all of this

58
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,570
new gardens to be planned and that’s

59
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,250
where the CAD side comes in

60
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,750
because it can make the process a

61
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,090
lot easier. So what is a forest

62
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,550
garden, I’ll just give you an overview

63
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,200
A forest garden

64
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,938
to quote Martin Crawford's fantastic book which

65
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,270
I refer to all the

66
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,310
time, Martin Crawford is a great

67
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,380
chap down in Devon and been creating

68
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,760
forest gardens for years and years and

69
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,470
years, and this is a bit of

70
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,510
a bible. It goes through a

71
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,630
whole range of different processes for setting

72
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,490
up a forest garden and all the

73
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,260
load of different species as well

74
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,660
And as he says, ‘it’s working with

75
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,480
nature to grow edible crops’ and this

76
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,210
is a photograph here from his garden

77
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,820
in Devon and what we’re doing is

78
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,240
to emulate the edge of woodland because

79
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,790
you want to have crops in the

80
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,950
understory and you want to have enough light

81
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,660
coming through. So it’s not thick dense

82
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,460
woodland, it’s the edge of woodland and

83
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,230
then you have different layers of plants

84
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,980
occupying that space. And it’s a

85
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,740
very good system because it uses

86
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,110
natural pest control and fertility, so you

87
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,420
grow all your fertility on site. So

88
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,310
essentially what you’re doing is to create

89
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,873
an edible ecosystem

90
00:03:37,263 --> 00:03:38,863
What is CAD? I’m very

91
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,010
glad you asked it is Computer Aided

92
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,050
Design. That’s a link there to the

93
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,050
Wikipedia article. Basically it’s a

94
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,230
line based drawing package; you’re creating precise

95
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,230
line diagrams and it’s used mostly in

96
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,690
architecture and manufacturing, where you need a

97
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,790
great deal of precision. We don’t really

98
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,040
need that precision in gardening. It’s

99
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,500
kind of useful but that’s not the

100
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,750
the major reason for using it. If

101
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,820
you compare it to drawing programs like

102
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:10,140
Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape, the massive difference is

103
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,630
that CAD is far far more scalable

104
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,550
and far faster. It doesn’t look as

105
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,890
pretty but it does, in my humble

106
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,810
opinion, it does the job a lot better

107
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,510
And we’re looking at 2D CAD, two

108
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,910
dimensional CAD, and this basically means that

109
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,460
it’s just in two dimensions

110
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,039
viewing it from above, and that’s a plan view

111
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:31,830
I use Open Source CAD

112
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,620
a package called QCAD which I absolutely

113
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,720
love. It’s brilliant, really lovely piece

114
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,360
of software. Open Source software

115
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,820
means the code for the software is

116
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,630
freely available online and the really

117
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,810
cool thing is that the price is

118
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,460
so much cheaper than any

119
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,880
commercial software. The industry standard Vectorworks costs

120
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,413
£1,230 per year

121
00:04:57,406 --> 00:04:59,340
it’s a subscription model, and

122
00:04:59,326 --> 00:05:02,460
that is just kind of outrageous and

123
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,320
to be honest, the free version of

124
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,510
QCAD is more than adequate for

125
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,210
CAD garden design. There is an alternative

126
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,100
to QCAD which is totally free called

127
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,870
LibreCAD and there’s a link in

128
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,500
the notes. I actually pay for the

129
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,960
paid version of QCAD, I paid about

130
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,680
£41

131
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,240
I think it is and the

132
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,980
reason for that really is to support

133
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,810
the developer because you have something which

134
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,940
is a good piece of software you want

135
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,770
the developer to keep on

136
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,000
working at it and to fix any

137
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,710
bugs and progress with it

138
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,380
There is a QCAD book as

139
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,560
well. Totally recommend getting that book, even

140
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,120
with the free version because there’s a

141
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,780
whole load of

142
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,550
information, there’s a lot of detail

143
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,840
there’s quite a stuff that you won’t

144
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,990
need but I’ll go through today showing

145
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,250
you the key points and you can

146
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,630
refer to them in the book

147
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,680
Do you even need CAD? You might

148
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,360
be better off using paper

149
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,290
if you’re only doing one design and

150
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,100
you’re not that comfortable using computers

151
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,710
5mm grid paper is

152
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,820
really good, I mean it’s a really

153
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,860
really good medium and it’s far freer

154
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,500
and in a lot of ways more flexible than

155
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,420
CAD but it’s not as easy to

156
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,440
work with if you’re working in a

157
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,480
group. This is the

158
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,680
5mm grid that you can see there!

159
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,230
If you’re working with a group of

160
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,800
people or people who are distributed around geographically

161
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,163
you actually might be better off learning CAD

162
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:28,110
Whatever you do use, get the

163
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,330
scale right, really really important to always

164
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,010
get the scale right. So that anything that

165
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,360
you add, any elements that you add

166
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,610
later on, will fit into that

167
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,530
And if you click on this image

168
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,260
it gives you a higher resolution, isn't

169
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,250
that fantastic?

170
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,570
So the CAD pros are that it’s

171
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,210
1:1 within the program itself

172
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,650
and what this means is you don’t

173
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,180
have to scale the drawing in the

174
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,910
software. If you’re creating a twenty metre

175
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,130
by twenty metre garden, you draw it as

176
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,260
twenty metres by twenty metres in the

177
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,170
software. This is as compared to using

178
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:01,920
Adobe Illustrator

179
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,142
where you have to scale

180
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,150
the drawing down, otherwise it slows the

181
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,430
program up too much. And that’s the

182
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,990
other thing about CAD as well, it’s

183
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,150
super fast. I run it on really

184
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,390
really ancient old PCs and it’s great

185
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,460
It’s just really really fast and it’s

186
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,370
accurate. It can slow down

187
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,050
if you’ve got thousands of plants on

188
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,300
there but there’s no need to worry

189
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,970
about the power of your PC. And

190
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,680
it’s easy to edit, as compared to

191
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,840
a paper plan where it can get

192
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,430
messy, and the more elements that you

193
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,630
have on a paper plan, and the

194
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,370
more you move things around the messier

195
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,500
it can get, whether you’re working with overlays

196
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,240
or whether you’re rubbing things out or

197
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,890
you’ve got little cutout bits of paper

198
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,240
to represent plants -

199
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,100
that can get a little bit

200
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,680
messy whereas you don’t have that with

201
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,800
using CAD. And it’s portable as well

202
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,880
This means that you can easily email

203
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,100
people a CAD file and you can

204
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,930
print it out as a PDF file

205
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,270
a Portable Document Format, and email that

206
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,410
to people too

207
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,620
The cons of using CAD are that it

208
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,900
is technical. I won’t lie to you

209
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,870
there is a steep learning curve to

210
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,000
it. You’ve got to put the hours

211
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,100
in to learn the software. But once

212
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,600
you do, and this is why it’s

213
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,950
worth it if you’re creating more than

214
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,530
one design, once you do master those

215
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,050
essential skills, then your workflow will

216
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:22,500
be much

217
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,440
quicker. And it is ugly. It’s not

218
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,230
designed to look pretty. So a nice

219
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,170
thing about Adobe Illustrator is that you

220
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,299
can create lots of shading and

221
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,470
different styles

222
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,110
But to be honest, if that’s what

223
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,250
you want to do, I would actually

224
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,350
suggest doing that within CAD and then

225
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,539
exporting that and then bringing that into

226
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,270
a different program to make it look prettier

227
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,570
Reasons to plan. In my book

228
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,000
there are five main reasons to plan

229
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,800
whether you’re using CAD or whether you’re

230
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,080
using paper. The first of these is

231
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,680
to get the spacing

232
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,960
right. In a forest garden, as

233
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,650
I mentioned before, the idea is to emulate

234
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,420
the edge of woodland, so you want

235
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,830
to have enough light coming through for

236
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,600
the understory and getting that spacing between

237
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,610
the trees is really really essential. That’s

238
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,380
like the main framework of the garden

239
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,790
design. The second reason is the position

240
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,780
and positioning of the

241
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,260
plants and positioning of the different features

242
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,440
within the garden and it’s much easier

243
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,330
with a plan to get an overview

244
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,950
of what’s going on in different parts

245
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,120
of the garden and how they relate to

246
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,600
each other

247
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,700
The third reason is quantity. CAD is absolutely

248
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,030
brilliant at calculating areas and lengths and you

249
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,830
can calc, from that you can work

250
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,740
out the quantity of plants that you require. Fourth

251
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,050
reason is communicate, so you’re communicating with

252
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,150
clients and you’re communicating with other people

253
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,550
you’re working with, whether that’s landscapers or

254
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,900
people who are putting the

255
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,140
plants out. And then finally documenting. Once

256
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,600
you’ve created your garden, it’s always

257
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,040
a good idea to know where things are

258
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,690
So tree spacing. This is an

259
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,940
illustration which has been inspired by Martin

260
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,310
Crawford’s book and this is tree spacing

261
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,880
within a forest garden. Martin Crawford

262
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,120
recommends

263
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,600
tree spacing of quarter to a half

264
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,940
of the average canopy diameter. So for

265
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,590
example you’ve got two 4 metre

266
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,990
diameter trees, then the tree spacing that

267
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,420
you want between them is 1 to

268
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,970
2 metres and that’s because you want

269
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,339
to get enough light coming through

270
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:26,970
Position

271
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,890
This is because a plan will enable

272
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,900
you to play with ideas far more

273
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,670
easily. If you’re trying to do it all

274
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,320
from memory, it could be hard to

275
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,570
remember where different things are. If you’ve

276
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,830
got a large site and you’re out

277
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,660
on site you can have great ideas

278
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,790
but it’s having somewhere to put all

279
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,120
those ideas. So it also

280
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,040
enables you, a plan, to try these

281
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,930
different positions quickly, so you can put

282
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,460
a tree in one place and then

283
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,290
put it into a totally opposite corner

284
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,660
of the garden very very quickly. And

285
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,980
it gives you an overview of the

286
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,140
different conditions within that garden, so like

287
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,570
where the water is or where the

288
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,400
light is rising and the sun

289
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:05,940
is setting

290
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,460
CAD is absolutely brilliant at working out

291
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,140
estimates, so you can figure out the

292
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,290
quantities of plants. This is a screenshot

293
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,970
from a design that I did for

294
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,900
a relatively small garden locally, and you

295
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,090
can see there’s an area here called Curve

296
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,320
it’s a kind of curved bed

297
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,270
and I can work

298
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,250
out really quickly that that’s 6

299
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,550
metres square. Likewise, there’s a line measuring

300
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,140
tool as well. And once you’ve got

301
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,370
an area and you know what your

302
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,440
planting density is, then it’s easy to

303
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,890
calculate how many plants you need. Likewise

304
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,140
if you’re planning a hedge, you know

305
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,730
how long that hedge is going to

306
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,900
be and you’ve got your planting

307
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,400
density for the

308
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,800
hedging plants then it’s again

309
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,840
very easy to calculate the quantities required

310
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,040
So, it works really really well with

311
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,450
a spreadsheet. For each of my

312
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,050
clients I create an online spreadsheet of

313
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,150
all the different plants and then I

314
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,070
can work out quantities from that and prices

315
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:05,820
from that as well

316
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,940
The fourth reason to create a plan

317
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,936
is the ability to communicate and that’s

318
00:12:14,936 --> 00:12:17,340
sharing ideas with partners, whether that’s clients

319
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,930
or other people that you’re working with

320
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,020
Really, a plan is like itself a

321
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,677
landscaping and a planting guide, so you’ve

322
00:12:25,677 --> 00:12:27,030
got any hard landscaping that you need

323
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,380
doing, any paths that need to be

324
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,960
put in or fencing, then people will

325
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,720
know the lengths and the dimensions. And

326
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,700
likewise with the planting guide, people know the

327
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,960
quantities of plants that need to be

328
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,460
put in and what densities are going

329
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,130
in at. And I always

330
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,890
create online notes for each my clients

331
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,180
and then I can share a

332
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,830
PDF of the plan

333
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,200
and the original CAD file with

334
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,210
with my clients that way, so they’ll

335
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,610
see it. And a plan is fantastic

336
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,110
as a guide for your future self

337
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,790
as well, so very often you think

338
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,470
you’ll know what you’re doing with the

339
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,490
design and what you’re doing with the

340
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,100
planting but if you write it down

341
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,710
is like an aide de memoire, it really

342
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,260
really helps. So, your future self will

343
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,460
thank you if you do

344
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,000
create a plan. The fifth reason is

345
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,660
to document your planting. Where on

346
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,130
earth did you put those plants? I’m

347
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,930
sure everyone's had this before in the

348
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,510
past, you can’t remember what plant is

349
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,800
in which bed, so if you have

350
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,506
a plan, it then changes the process and

351
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,040
it becomes a document that you can

352
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,080
refer to and it tells you where

353
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,330
your plants are. And don’t forget like

354
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,740
the seasonal differences in the middle of

355
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,530
winter then all herbaceous perennials would

356
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,060
have died down so they're not going to

357
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,490
be so visible. It’s also a really

358
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,920
good document to educate the partners with

359
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,740
And management is a top priority, even

360
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,670
though it’s at the bottom of the

361
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,670
the list. I think working out how

362
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,710
a garden will be cared for and

363
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,590
managed long-term is really really important. So

364
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,150
if you’ve got a document in

365
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,830
the form of a plan that gives

366
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,180
a client something to work from

367
00:14:01,196 --> 00:14:03,086
Greetings and welcome back to the second

368
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:05,216
part of my online class ‘CAD for

369
00:14:05,216 --> 00:14:07,016
Gardeners’ and here I’m going to be

370
00:14:07,016 --> 00:14:10,286
talking about setting up QCAD, now QCAD

371
00:14:10,346 --> 00:14:12,026
is my most favourite piece of CAD

372
00:14:12,026 --> 00:14:14,456
software, it’s absolutely brilliant and the free

373
00:14:14,456 --> 00:14:17,216
version is more than adequate for any

374
00:14:17,246 --> 00:14:20,426
kind of CAD garden design. It can

375
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:20,648
be a

376
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,076
little bit fiddly to be honest though

377
00:14:22,286 --> 00:14:24,296
to get the free version and to

378
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,562
get rid of the trial

379
00:14:25,556 --> 00:14:27,056
You have to download the QCAD

380
00:14:27,086 --> 00:14:30,146
trial and there’s a few steps involved

381
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,946
in doing this. But I want

382
00:14:31,946 --> 00:14:33,566
to get this right, so that you’ve

383
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:35,396
got some reference and you’ve got

384
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:37,496
a CAD environment that you’re happy with

385
00:14:38,216 --> 00:14:40,196
So let’s get cracking with this. Press

386
00:14:40,196 --> 00:14:40,886
the `P` key

387
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,266
and it brings up the notes and, as

388
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:43,436
you can see, there’s quite a few

389
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:47,306
notes here. There are seven different steps

390
00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:52,706
and the first one is to install

391
00:14:52,736 --> 00:14:54,986
QCAD. You need to download it, go

392
00:14:54,986 --> 00:14:57,356
to QCAD.org and download

393
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:59,366
it. There’s three different versions — for Windows

394
00:14:59,396 --> 00:15:02,096
Mac and Linux — and download the appropriate

395
00:15:02,096 --> 00:15:04,166
version for your operating system and for

396
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,866
your computer. And then you need to

397
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:08,186
install it. Again

398
00:15:08,816 --> 00:15:10,346
go to QCAD.org, in the

399
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:14,456
documentation there’s an installation guide for Windows

400
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,946
Mac and Linux and, yeah, I won’t

401
00:15:16,946 --> 00:15:18,416
go into the details because that really

402
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,286
would be a bit dull

403
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:22,166
but there we have it. So, get

404
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,006
cracking with that

405
00:15:24,476 --> 00:15:26,786
Once you’ve installed it on your computer

406
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:30,446
let’s start it up. So, we’re going to

407
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:33,324
set the units to metres

408
00:15:33,324 --> 00:15:34,376
that’s going to be the first job

409
00:15:34,526 --> 00:15:37,256
So, double-click to start and then

410
00:15:37,256 --> 00:15:41,096
go to unit and metre and click

411
00:15:41,096 --> 00:15:44,246
`OK`. Now, I use metres because

412
00:15:44,246 --> 00:15:45,686
I’m in the UK and

413
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:48,716
metres are a really good unit to use

414
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:51,206
because they're approximate enough for gardening

415
00:15:51,206 --> 00:15:52,136
and they don’t have to be super

416
00:15:52,136 --> 00:15:53,966
super accurate and are not like millimetres

417
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:57,896
for architecture or micrometres for manufacturing

418
00:15:58,226 --> 00:15:59,876
So it really depends though where you

419
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,016
are in the world as to what

420
00:16:01,046 --> 00:16:03,746
units you’ll be using. But something like

421
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:04,406
metres is great

422
00:16:04,406 --> 00:16:06,416
So the first thing that we

423
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,366
need to do is to remove the

424
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:10,946
trial plugins and this is the most

425
00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:13,976
painful part and the dullest bit

426
00:16:14,186 --> 00:16:16,376
*but* it is kind of necessary. I’ve

427
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:18,446
listed them here so you

428
00:16:18,446 --> 00:16:19,976
need to find out where your plugins

429
00:16:19,976 --> 00:16:22,076
folder is and the plugins folder

430
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:24,386
obviously it depends which operating system

431
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:24,566
you’re

432
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,366
working on. I’ll show you where

433
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:29,066
the plugins are on here

434
00:16:29,276 --> 00:16:31,196
and if we go, I know that

435
00:16:31,196 --> 00:16:33,386
QCAD on linux is installed in

436
00:16:33,386 --> 00:16:36,596
the `opt` folder, double-click on that, go in

437
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:37,466
to QCAD

438
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:40,856
and then there’s the plugins there and

439
00:16:40,856 --> 00:16:42,386
I’ll view them as a

440
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,696
list, makes it easier to delete

441
00:16:44,696 --> 00:16:46,766
them, so the list view. Basically, you want

442
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:48,896
to delete all of the

443
00:16:48,896 --> 00:16:51,776
plugins apart from these three here, so

444
00:16:51,776 --> 00:16:53,726
the easiest thing is to

445
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:56,966
select all the plugins and then deselect

446
00:16:57,086 --> 00:16:58,646
`libqcaddarkstyle`

447
00:16:58,646 --> 00:17:02,279
`libqcaddxf`

448
00:17:02,276 --> 00:17:04,776
and `libqcadscripts`

449
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:06,896
Select all the plugins

450
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:12,356
like so, and then control-click

451
00:17:12,358 --> 00:17:15,326
`libqcaddarkstyle`, `libqcaddxf`

452
00:17:15,746 --> 00:17:18,296
and `libqcadscripts`. I’m going to

453
00:17:18,296 --> 00:17:19,976
send the rest of the stuff to

454
00:17:19,976 --> 00:17:22,856
the wastebasket. And then we go back

455
00:17:22,856 --> 00:17:25,346
into CAD and then in the widget

456
00:17:25,346 --> 00:17:27,506
on the side there’s a little button that says `Remove`

457
00:17:27,536 --> 00:17:28,165
click on `Remove`

458
00:17:28,165 --> 00:17:29,846
“To remove this add-on please

459
00:17:29,846 --> 00:17:31,586
delete the following plugins” and you go

460
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:34,616
“Yep, already done it.” The next step

461
00:17:34,646 --> 00:17:36,446
that I want to do is to

462
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:38,846
set the theme to dark and the

463
00:17:38,846 --> 00:17:41,126
background to dark grey. And the reason

464
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,856
for doing this is that I find

465
00:17:43,886 --> 00:17:46,406
an awful lot easier with the range

466
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:48,326
of standard colours in

467
00:17:48,326 --> 00:17:50,696
QCAD to work on a dark background —

468
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,406
they show up much more easily

469
00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:56,846
So go into CAD, click on `Application

470
00:17:56,846 --> 00:18:00,866
Preferences`, scroll down to `Theme`

471
00:18:02,186 --> 00:18:05,934
and then choose `Dark`. Click `OK`, it’ll

472
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:07,886
say you need to restart QCAD

473
00:18:08,006 --> 00:18:10,406
So go `OK`, quit out of

474
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:12,806
QCAD and let’s restart it. And here

475
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:14,726
we go, a nice dark theme to

476
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,006
QCAD. One last thing I want to

477
00:18:17,006 --> 00:18:18,626
do with the colours is to change the

478
00:18:18,626 --> 00:18:20,096
background because I find that black a

479
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:22,046
bit too much, a bit too intense

480
00:18:22,316 --> 00:18:24,650
a bit too doom and gloom. So

481
00:18:24,656 --> 00:18:28,256
go to `Application Preferences` and then if

482
00:18:28,256 --> 00:18:30,926
you look under `Graphics View` down here

483
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:33,596
`Colors` and then

484
00:18:34,676 --> 00:18:36,116
`Background` and I’m going to set the

485
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:38,006
background to `Others…` and I’m going to

486
00:18:38,006 --> 00:18:40,196
give it a grey color. And the

487
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:41,636
colour that I use, you can use

488
00:18:41,636 --> 00:18:43,196
whatever grey, you know, you can

489
00:18:43,196 --> 00:18:44,936
choose a colour from here, the one

490
00:18:44,936 --> 00:18:47,666
that I use as a standard is

491
00:18:47,696 --> 00:18:50,396
3e3e3e, that’s a nice

492
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,156
combination of nice calming grey. And the

493
00:18:53,156 --> 00:18:54,086
final couple of things we’re going to

494
00:18:54,086 --> 00:18:54,746
do is

495
00:18:54,806 --> 00:18:57,026
to play around with the widgets

496
00:18:57,026 --> 00:18:59,126
I want to hide the `Command Line` widget

497
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:00,986
at the bottom and then show

498
00:19:00,986 --> 00:19:02,966
the `Block List`, so if you go

499
00:19:02,966 --> 00:19:05,966
to the `View` menu and then the

500
00:19:05,996 --> 00:19:10,406
`Command Line` there, gets rid of it

501
00:19:10,406 --> 00:19:12,386
at the bottom, and then the `View`

502
00:19:12,386 --> 00:19:14,786
menu and the `Block List` and it

503
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:14,966
brings

504
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:16,016
up your `Block List`

505
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,676
And then finally, finally, what I like

506
00:19:19,676 --> 00:19:22,526
to do is to stack the `Layer`

507
00:19:22,706 --> 00:19:25,616
`Property` and `Block` widgets. So these are

508
00:19:25,616 --> 00:19:27,146
the widgets, there’s the `Layer` and the

509
00:19:27,176 --> 00:19:29,156
`Block`. I put the `Layer` on first

510
00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:31,646
and the reason for this is, this

511
00:19:31,646 --> 00:19:33,536
is the widget I use

512
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:34,826
the most, so it’s always kind of

513
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:36,386
very handy to see which layer you’re

514
00:19:36,386 --> 00:19:37,076
working on

515
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,956
And then I’ll pop in the `Property

516
00:19:39,986 --> 00:19:43,646
Editor`, the `Property Editor` widget in

517
00:19:43,646 --> 00:19:46,376
the middle, and that always has a

518
00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:48,746
lot of useful information in. And the

519
00:19:48,746 --> 00:19:50,366
one I use the least is the

520
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:52,166
`Block List`, that goes at the bottom

521
00:19:53,006 --> 00:19:54,626
And there we have it, we’re all set

522
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,216
up and ready to rock 🤘

523
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,989
Greetings and welcome back to the third

524
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,490
section of my online class ‘CAD for

525
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:04,256
Gardeners’ and this is shapes, entities and

526
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:06,426
mods, you can just about see

527
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:08,473
the mods, my face is nearly covering

528
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:10,716
it, and here I’m going to be

529
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:14,873
looking at four basic shapes, three entity

530
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:16,696
types and then four modifications

531
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,710
that you can make. And using

532
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:21,913
these tools, you can create a whole

533
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:26,523
infinite variety of different designs, hopefully. First

534
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:28,423
of all, before going further, I wanted

535
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:31,283
to say about finding your way

536
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:33,066
around QCAD because it can be a

537
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,506
little bit confusing. So I’m just going

538
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,510
to zip over to QCAD

539
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,149
I’ll create a new file, I’m

540
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,546
just going to create a circle and

541
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:43,559
really worry too much about what I’m

542
00:20:43,566 --> 00:20:44,076
doing here…

543
00:20:45,966 --> 00:20:47,796
The great thing as I said before

544
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,539
about QCAD is that you can

545
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:51,663
zoom in and you can zoom out

546
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:54,416
and it can be two hundred miles

547
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:56,473
wide or it can be twenty centimetres

548
00:20:56,466 --> 00:20:59,406
wide. The QCAD doesn’t really matter

549
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,990
it’s kind of 1:1 scale

550
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,920
and you work at whatever size

551
00:21:02,966 --> 00:21:04,256
the thing is that you’re working on

552
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,399
Erm…

553
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,550
so for zooming in, zooming out, there’s

554
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:10,546
the mouse scroll. Sorry, that’s a really

555
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:12,483
really bad pun. That is a mouse

556
00:21:12,633 --> 00:21:14,373
with a scroll, took ages to

557
00:21:14,366 --> 00:21:16,976
find that one. Mouse scroll will zoom

558
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,320
you in and out so the mouse

559
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,580
scroll is that button there and that

560
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,379
will zoom you in and out in CAD. The plus

561
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:24,956
or minus keys on your keyboard

562
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,280
Snd then if you get lost, it’s

563
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:32,383
`View > Zoom > Auto Zoom` and that will

564
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:33,856
get you back to where

565
00:21:33,866 --> 00:21:35,486
your drawing is. I’ll just show you what

566
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,910
I mean. So mouse scroll first of

567
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,180
all, so mouse scroll, zoom in and

568
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,520
you can zoom in, zoom in and

569
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,810
zoom in and zoom in and and

570
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,113
it’s just incredible how much you

571
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,729
can zoom in

572
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:48,343
until your screen is filled with

573
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,793
a line. Then you can zoom out

574
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,300
as well and you can zoom out

575
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,379
and the problem with this zooming

576
00:21:54,366 --> 00:21:55,926
in, zooming out, plus minus keys

577
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,969
minus, plus… oopsie, the problem

578
00:22:00,966 --> 00:22:02,586
is, it’s actually really really easy to

579
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,699
get lost and I’ve got no idea

580
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,360
where my circle’s gone. So if you

581
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,660
go to `View` menu and then `Zoom`

582
00:22:11,866 --> 00:22:15,706
and zoom auto, `Auto Zoom` which has

583
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,120
`ZA` as the

584
00:22:17,266 --> 00:22:19,576
keyboard shortcut. It’s kinda nice to use

585
00:22:19,566 --> 00:22:21,396
keyboard shortcuts because it speeds things up

586
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,530
but don’t worry about it. So click

587
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:26,743
on `Auto Zoom`, wmf, it brings your

588
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:28,923
drawing into full view. So if you’re

589
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:30,553
zooming in and zooming out, you don’t

590
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:33,776
know where you are, click `View > Zoom >

591
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:36,196
Auto Zoom` and it brings you straight

592
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,340
back. I’ll just do it again, `View >

593
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:40,363
Zoom > Auto Zoom` it brings you

594
00:22:40,366 --> 00:22:44,836
straight back. Okay? The next

595
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:47,443
thing is panning, so with panning

596
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,403
that means kind of scrubbing or

597
00:22:50,433 --> 00:22:52,863
moving across the screen

598
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,120
So that’s a mouse scroll click, so

599
00:22:56,066 --> 00:22:57,836
again the mouse scroll button and then click

600
00:22:57,866 --> 00:22:59,516
it down and then you

601
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,020
can pan around the document

602
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,210
or `View > Zoom > Pan Zoom`, so holding

603
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:07,583
down the mouse scroll you know

604
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:08,766
you can

605
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,380
pan across like that or `View > Zoom >

606
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,790
Pan Zoom` and that enables you to

607
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,106
scroll down and get really really dizzy

608
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,373
So the next bit that I wanted

609
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:21,856
to show you was what what happens

610
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:25,143
if you kind of get lost at all

611
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:28,136
The thing to remember, is don’t

612
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:28,673
panic

613
00:23:28,966 --> 00:23:31,426
So there’s two ways that I can

614
00:23:31,433 --> 00:23:33,233
get lost. Firstly, as I said before

615
00:23:33,466 --> 00:23:37,486
is zooming and zooming out, so

616
00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:40,286
that’s `View > Zoom > Auto Zoom`, so if

617
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,560
I don’t know where I am and

618
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:44,843
I can’t see anything, `ZA`, bof!

619
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,880
Brings it straight back. The other thing

620
00:23:46,866 --> 00:23:49,026
is, if I’ve started clicking on different

621
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,929
tools and I don’t know how to

622
00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:53,183
get back to the pointer, just hit

623
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,146
the escape key and that returns you

624
00:23:55,466 --> 00:23:57,686
to the arrow tool. So, just keep

625
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,440
hitting it and eventually you’ll get back

626
00:23:59,433 --> 00:24:00,843
to the pointer tool and

627
00:24:00,866 --> 00:24:02,996
then get back to square one, okay

628
00:24:02,966 --> 00:24:05,456
So those two tools are really really useful

629
00:24:05,866 --> 00:24:07,279
to get back to

630
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:08,703
your drawing and also to get back

631
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,240
to your arrow

632
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,349
Right, so next up is shapes

633
00:24:12,366 --> 00:24:15,306
entities and mods. As I said, four

634
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,179
shapes, three entities and four mods. What

635
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,670
you want to do, press the `P`

636
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,486
key again, you want to download the files

637
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,140
from here. This is the CAD

638
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:27,926
gardener’s files and I’ll just show you

639
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,340
where you get them from

640
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,350
So this is where the files are

641
00:24:31,366 --> 00:24:34,246
stored and the files are in a

642
00:24:34,233 --> 00:24:36,693
folder called `cad-shapes-entities-mods`, probably

643
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,140
the easiest thing to do is download them

644
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:39,663
altogether, so if you click on the

645
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,580
`Code` button and then `Download zip`, unzip

646
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:43,736
it and then you’ve got the CAD

647
00:24:43,766 --> 00:24:45,146
files that you can play around with

648
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,520
First thing then that we’re going to

649
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:46,830
do

650
00:24:47,966 --> 00:24:50,066
is to look at creating the four

651
00:24:50,066 --> 00:24:52,646
shapes. So you’ve got a rectangle, line

652
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,250
tool, circles for trees and NURBS for

653
00:24:55,233 --> 00:24:59,403
curves. How terribly exciting. So rectangle is under

654
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,500
the `Shape Tools` in the

655
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,960
toolbar menu and the two rectangles that I

656
00:25:03,966 --> 00:25:06,096
use all the time, there’s like one

657
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,050
which is just drawing a rectangle, so

658
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:09,033
yeah, I know that it

659
00:25:10,433 --> 00:25:11,483
will be drawn like that

660
00:25:12,633 --> 00:25:14,703
Hit escape key, back for the pointer and

661
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,230
it draws a rectangle

662
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,350
made out of lines

663
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,150
And the other one that I use

664
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,740
probably a lot more, is the rectangle

665
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:26,566
with size and this is actually really

666
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,996
useful. So say I’ve got a, oh I don’t

667
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,970
know, I’ve got a shed that’s

668
00:25:31,966 --> 00:25:34,366
3 metres by 2 metres

669
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,769
I kind of just put the size

670
00:25:37,766 --> 00:25:39,086
in, along the top here

671
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:42,213
and then there we go, it’s

672
00:25:42,266 --> 00:25:44,574
a shed which is fantastic. So

673
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:46,968
that’s a rectangle tool. We use rectangles

674
00:25:46,966 --> 00:25:49,036
mostly for structures in a garden, so

675
00:25:49,066 --> 00:25:51,586
sheds, some polytunnels and steps and

676
00:25:51,566 --> 00:25:54,896
stuff like that. The next tool is

677
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:57,543
the line tool. So hit `Escape` to go

678
00:25:57,566 --> 00:26:00,056
back to the arrow tool

679
00:26:00,566 --> 00:26:02,606
click on `Line Tools` and I only ever

680
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,939
use one line tool and that is

681
00:26:04,933 --> 00:26:06,823
this one here, which is `Line from

682
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:09,323
2 Points`. And I just go… pom-ti-dom…

683
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,300
create a line like

684
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,939
that. And a line tools good for kind

685
00:26:14,966 --> 00:26:19,514
of irregular non-rectilinear shapes and it’s also

686
00:26:19,533 --> 00:26:20,523
really really good for

687
00:26:20,533 --> 00:26:21,583
for creating

688
00:26:23,366 --> 00:26:25,796
paths, for example, so you don’t have

689
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,179
to use NURBS, you don’t have to

690
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,760
create curvy paths, if you

691
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,929
want to just for quickness

692
00:26:30,933 --> 00:26:33,393
you can create a basic path like

693
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,310
that, yeah, so that’s the kind of

694
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,379
thing that you can use it for

695
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,410
as well. And then creating boundaries. I’ll

696
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,570
be going through all these when I

697
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,066
do the examples as well, to give

698
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:42,786
you some real world

699
00:26:42,866 --> 00:26:46,226
examples. The third shape is

700
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:50,515
a circle and again, the circle tool, and

701
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:52,161
I only ever create, it’s all

702
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:54,146
these different options, it’s mind blowing

703
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:56,053
how many different options there are and what

704
00:26:56,066 --> 00:26:58,046
you can do with them and tangents

705
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,439
and all sorts of stuff, but I

706
00:26:59,433 --> 00:27:01,057
only ever use one circle and that’s

707
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:03,016
circles for trees, so you click

708
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,270
there

709
00:27:04,866 --> 00:27:08,106
we go, and that tool is called

710
00:27:08,266 --> 00:27:10,136
let’s just make sure I’ve got the right name, `Center

711
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:12,026
Point`, so you draw a circle from the

712
00:27:12,033 --> 00:27:14,553
point and there we go and you

713
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,876
can just draw circles for trees. And this

714
00:27:16,866 --> 00:27:18,906
is where the `Property` widget comes in

715
00:27:18,933 --> 00:27:21,093
really really handy because what you can

716
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,189
do, select the shape and then say

717
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:24,620
oh

718
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,850
I don’t know, there’s a Sweet Chestnut

719
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,680
is roughly 15 metres diameter, if you

720
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:33,666
look in the `Property Editor` under diameter

721
00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:36,343
down here on the right hand side

722
00:27:36,733 --> 00:27:39,283
and then type in 15, there you

723
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:42,086
go, that’s the diameter of a Sweet

724
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,373
Chestnut. And then I can say ‘Oh

725
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,778
right then, I want to create another

726
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:47,896
one’. And this is going to be

727
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,270
4 metres wide because that’s the diameter

728
00:27:50,766 --> 00:27:53,976
Select, draw the circle, select it, diameter

729
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:54,789
4

730
00:27:55,433 --> 00:27:58,133
And that’s the diameter of an apple

731
00:27:58,133 --> 00:28:00,053
tree on an MM106

732
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:03,423
rootstock, for example. So now you’ve got

733
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:05,303
circles for trees, and then you can

734
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,430
work out, using the tree spacing, you

735
00:28:07,433 --> 00:28:10,973
can calculate the distance actually it

736
00:28:10,966 --> 00:28:12,436
should be between the trees. And

737
00:28:12,433 --> 00:28:15,013
finally, NURBS. I wasn't going to show

738
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,800
show you NURBS but they’re so great

739
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,090
that’s such a brilliant name, it

740
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,459
stands for Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines

741
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,510
I think. Have a play and

742
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,580
if you like them and get on

743
00:28:24,566 --> 00:28:26,396
with them, then use them. Again, I only

744
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,170
ever use one spline tool, this one

745
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,506
at the top, spline with control points

746
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,909
And you can click, click, click, double-

747
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,780
click to stop the drawing, escape

748
00:28:39,866 --> 00:28:41,306
to get the arrow tool back and

749
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,120
then you’ve got a control point, which

750
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,040
is here, which is fantastic

751
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:51,266
There we go and then obviously

752
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:53,908
you can create a lot more complex shapes

753
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:56,541
so if you’re creating a path, it’s a

754
00:28:56,566 --> 00:29:00,046
wibbly wobbly path, you can do

755
00:29:00,033 --> 00:29:03,033
all sorts of great, great, great fun

756
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:03,693
stuff

757
00:29:05,066 --> 00:29:06,686
This is a really good moment to

758
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,410
talk about the snap tool because this

759
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,870
makes your life an awful lot easier

760
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,259
So what it’s set to by default

761
00:29:12,266 --> 00:29:14,816
when you create a shape, let’s go

762
00:29:14,866 --> 00:29:16,426
back and get a line tool because it’ll

763
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:19,673
be probably easier, it’s snapping to the

764
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:20,236
grid

765
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:23,783
or it’s snapping on an intersection

766
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:29,513
and that’s the default behavior. So it

767
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,390
kind of guesses where you want

768
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,530
to snap to which is great but

769
00:29:33,533 --> 00:29:35,453
sometimes you say ‘I want it just

770
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:36,774
over here’ and it’s not enough

771
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,609
you want to make a free play

772
00:29:38,666 --> 00:29:41,156
sort of thing for your snapping and

773
00:29:41,133 --> 00:29:42,243
the way to do that is to

774
00:29:42,266 --> 00:29:44,576
use `Snap Free`. So if you go

775
00:29:44,566 --> 00:29:45,016
to the `Snap`

776
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,240
menu and then go `Snap Free`

777
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:51,386
or `SF` is a shortcut, then

778
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,076
it’s not snapping to anything

779
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,479
at all. So it means it won’t

780
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,940
snap onto a line. So it depends

781
00:29:55,933 --> 00:29:56,923
what you’re trying

782
00:29:56,933 --> 00:29:58,433
to achieve. I don’t know, like if you’ve

783
00:29:58,433 --> 00:30:00,173
got a curvy curvy path that

784
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,876
you want to make then you

785
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,366
don’t really want to have it snapping

786
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:05,166
directly to a grid or directly to another object

787
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,120
Sometimes you do want it to snap

788
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:08,213
so for example if I wanted to

789
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,940
close this shape, I want it to snap

790
00:30:09,966 --> 00:30:11,376
on the corner but it’s not going

791
00:30:11,366 --> 00:30:13,196
to, it’s just going to do it a

792
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,660
little bit away. So `Snap Free`

793
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:17,526
really very useful for freehand stuff

794
00:30:18,866 --> 00:30:19,826
And then the other one that you

795
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:20,163
want

796
00:30:21,366 --> 00:30:24,246
quite commonly is `Snap On Entity`, which

797
00:30:24,266 --> 00:30:26,786
is `ST`, so get a line tool

798
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,389
and I say okay, I know that

799
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,550
I want to snap onto the rectangle

800
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,850
somewhere, see, it’s auto-snapping

801
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:35,366
here, you can see it’s auto-snapping

802
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,256
to the middle and auto-snapping to

803
00:30:37,266 --> 00:30:39,186
the intersection but I want it to

804
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:41,446
snap on the actual entity

805
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,523
itself, like on this circle

806
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:46,593
for example. If I go `Snap On

807
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,439
Entity`

808
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:50,376
then it will glue itself to that

809
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,190
entity. And I want to

810
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,258
take it off, I can go `Snap Auto`

811
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,370
`Snap Auto` down here, and then it’s

812
00:31:00,366 --> 00:31:02,226
going back to automatically snapping

813
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:03,436
to the grid or to the end

814
00:31:03,433 --> 00:31:06,072
of something else. So that’s a

815
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:07,777
really really handy one. The final

816
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,100
snap is `Snap to End`, so this is

817
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:12,543
great if you’ve got a shape and

818
00:31:12,533 --> 00:31:13,793
you say I want to

819
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,030
close this shape here

820
00:31:16,366 --> 00:31:18,016
so it’s like a closed

821
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:18,453
shape

822
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:21,153
So what you do there, get the

823
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:23,473
line tool and

824
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:26,389
you can click, snap, and just to

825
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,874
make sure it snaps on end you

826
00:31:27,866 --> 00:31:31,431
go `Snap on End`, bomf! It

827
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:33,478
won’t snap anywhere else and you’re guaranteed

828
00:31:33,466 --> 00:31:35,836
that that shape is enclosed now. So

829
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:41,426
these snapping facilities are really really useful

830
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:42,666
it’s really handy to know

831
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:44,646
them. And it’s, yeah, just be aware

832
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:45,894
that you’ve got the snap menu

833
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,912
there and then you can use the

834
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,750
snapping tools as and when you see

835
00:31:50,766 --> 00:31:52,086
fit. So when it comes up, you

836
00:31:52,066 --> 00:31:53,656
go ‘Why won’t this

837
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,440
line go here?’ and you can figure out

838
00:31:55,433 --> 00:31:56,783
whether it needs to be `Snap Auto`

839
00:31:56,766 --> 00:31:58,896
or `Snap Free` or `Snap Entity` or

840
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,190
`Snap to the End`

841
00:32:01,566 --> 00:32:05,136
Okay, let’s get onto the entities. We’ve

842
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:08,976
got three entities, that’s block, polyline and

843
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,160
text, and they're all pretty

844
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:14,076
cool in their own special ways. A

845
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:17,306
block is really really useful if you’re

846
00:32:17,533 --> 00:32:20,053
creating a symbol. It can be re-used

847
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,389
over and over again. So for example

848
00:32:21,366 --> 00:32:23,186
you have an orchard and it’s

849
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,790
got a lot of the same apple

850
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,090
trees in it. You can just make

851
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,919
one apple tree and then plant lots

852
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,150
of different instances around. When you edit

853
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,356
the one block, it changes all those

854
00:32:33,366 --> 00:32:36,846
instances. But it’s also useful for creating

855
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:38,603
a shape and then applying any angle

856
00:32:39,066 --> 00:32:40,866
So in this example I’ve created a

857
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:41,466
bench

858
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:43,016
and I’ve then created an angle

859
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,930
on it. I’ll show you how to

860
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:45,493
do that. So hit escape to go

861
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,650
back to the arrow tool, go click

862
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,666
onto the shape tools and I’ll

863
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:54,846
just create any old rectangle

864
00:32:56,533 --> 00:32:58,843
And rather than, what you can

865
00:32:58,866 --> 00:33:00,696
do, if you go into the shape

866
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,366
tools and then shape with

867
00:33:03,366 --> 00:33:05,706
sizes, you can put an angle in

868
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,730
here but then it’s much harder once

869
00:33:08,733 --> 00:33:10,623
you’ve created that angle. Once you’ve created

870
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,639
that shape, it’s much much harder to

871
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:15,306
edit it. So you’re better off creating

872
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:16,076
it so that it’s

873
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,269
square and *then* applying the angle afterwards

874
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:22,353
So I’ll just show you how to

875
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,923
create a block, so you select all

876
00:33:23,933 --> 00:33:24,323
those

877
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,110
elements, go to the `Block` menu and

878
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:32,539
then `Create Block From Selection` and then

879
00:33:32,533 --> 00:33:33,673
you say where you want to create

880
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:35,346
it from, sets the corner, and I’m

881
00:33:35,366 --> 00:33:37,616
going to call it, I don’t know, shed

882
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:40,723
And down here in the `Block List`

883
00:33:40,733 --> 00:33:41,963
on the right hand side you can see

884
00:33:41,966 --> 00:33:43,196
shed comes up and then I can

885
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,630
have multiple sheds

886
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:47,163
and I can put sheds down all

887
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:50,436
over the place. Hooray. So now, for

888
00:33:50,433 --> 00:33:52,719
example, I want to edit it, I’m

889
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,524
gonna say I want to

890
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,263
I don’t know, colour the lines

891
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,310
make the lines a different colour, I’ll

892
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,769
make them green

893
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,020
And then go out, and so now I’ve

894
00:34:05,033 --> 00:34:07,043
got green sheds all over the place

895
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,760
But if I just want to rotate

896
00:34:09,766 --> 00:34:11,986
one of my sheds, I can go

897
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,520
here and I’ll just give it an

898
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,190
angle in the `Properties`, it’s 45 degrees

899
00:34:18,466 --> 00:34:20,895
type in 45 degrees and just

900
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,101
that instance has

901
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,690
changed so that’s really kind of, yeah

902
00:34:23,766 --> 00:34:25,776
it’s really really handy and then you

903
00:34:25,766 --> 00:34:26,845
can make sure that you get the

904
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:29,353
right angle and it’s much much easier

905
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,770
to control. Cool

906
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:36,367
The other entity that I want to

907
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:39,216
talk about was the polyline and these

908
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,969
are great. Best way to show you

909
00:34:40,966 --> 00:34:43,065
this is with the line tool so

910
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:44,384
go for the line tool

911
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:47,953
and I’ll create kind of

912
00:34:48,033 --> 00:34:51,573
linage thing, wibbly wobbly line, eeeh!

913
00:34:51,566 --> 00:34:53,396
And that’s great and you go well that’s

914
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,329
fantastic

915
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,051
but the pain in the bum is

916
00:34:57,066 --> 00:34:58,506
that I have to create a shift

917
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,020
click every single item before I want

918
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,560
to move it or have to select

919
00:35:02,566 --> 00:35:04,636
them all by dragging it like that

920
00:35:04,933 --> 00:35:06,283
and that can be a bit painful

921
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,830
So it’s much better

922
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,280
or you can double-click and it

923
00:35:10,266 --> 00:35:11,796
will select the whole shape, but unless

924
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,780
the shape then is touching

925
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,180
something else it’ll select all that as

926
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:18,196
well, so much much better to create

927
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:21,203
a polyline of that line. So

928
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,464
create a polyline, dom-dom, double-click to

929
00:35:23,466 --> 00:35:25,446
select all of them and you go

930
00:35:25,766 --> 00:35:28,256
`Draw > Polyline >

931
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,700
Polyline From Selection` and I am constantly

932
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,979
amazed at the number of different options

933
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,216
that we’ve got but just concentrate, all

934
00:35:37,233 --> 00:35:39,363
you have to do is concentrate on

935
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:40,776
the ones I’m giving you and

936
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:42,176
that to be honest these are all

937
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:44,026
the only ones I ever use myself

938
00:35:44,466 --> 00:35:49,176
So `Polyline From Selection`, there we go

939
00:35:49,366 --> 00:35:51,946
now, wow, look, it treats it as a

940
00:35:51,966 --> 00:35:52,986
whole kind of group

941
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:56,133
And what it also does, if you

942
00:35:56,133 --> 00:35:57,843
click on it, it will give you

943
00:35:57,866 --> 00:36:00,026
an area, so try and work out

944
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,323
what that area is

945
00:36:03,766 --> 00:36:06,436
Another handy tool, if you’ve got a

946
00:36:06,433 --> 00:36:09,283
polyline, then you want to explode it. This

947
00:36:09,366 --> 00:36:11,556
really ought to be in modifications but

948
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:14,023
there’s a bomb here, set off that

949
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:18,503
stick of dynamite, boff! it explodes it and

950
00:36:18,866 --> 00:36:20,096
what I want to do now is

951
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,830
to close that line, so hit

952
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:22,571
escape key

953
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,279
to go back to the arrow tool

954
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,890
click on the line tool and I’m

955
00:36:25,866 --> 00:36:28,416
going to close that shape and now

956
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:31,726
you can imagine, double-click, create a

957
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:34,673
polyline from that and you can say

958
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:38,236
yep, that is now a garden bed

959
00:36:38,433 --> 00:36:39,963
and I know that by clicking on

960
00:36:39,966 --> 00:36:41,946
it, this is about the garden bed

961
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:42,563
is

962
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:46,013
about 5 metres diameter [square!] and with a

963
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,640
planting density of 5 plants per square

964
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:51,426
metre, that’s 25 plants, thank you

965
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,690
very much. So this is where it

966
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,460
comes in really really useful using these

967
00:36:55,466 --> 00:36:59,036
different tools. And then finally the last

968
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,979
entity that I wanted to discuss is

969
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:02,876
text tool

970
00:37:02,933 --> 00:37:04,523
And it kinda does what it says

971
00:37:04,533 --> 00:37:06,363
on the tin really, enables you to

972
00:37:06,366 --> 00:37:08,466
put labels on things which is handy

973
00:37:08,466 --> 00:37:09,276
if you want to know what the

974
00:37:09,266 --> 00:37:10,826
trees are that you’re using

975
00:37:11,066 --> 00:37:13,586
or what a particular structure is so

976
00:37:13,766 --> 00:37:14,366
double-click

977
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,593
and then escape to go back to

978
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,270
the tool menu and arrow tool and

979
00:37:20,266 --> 00:37:21,675
I’m going to click on the text

980
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:24,366
tool. Click on `Text` and it brings up

981
00:37:24,933 --> 00:37:27,183
the whole lot here. For some reason

982
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,960
I always colour my text orange I

983
00:37:28,966 --> 00:37:30,256
think it’s a middle

984
00:37:30,266 --> 00:37:31,856
of the road colour and fits in

985
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:35,136
with everything else. I’m going to call this shed

986
00:37:35,566 --> 00:37:39,016
I’m gonna make it orange and think

987
00:37:39,033 --> 00:37:42,993
it needs to be a bit smaller, there we go and

988
00:37:42,966 --> 00:37:44,346
you’ve got lots of options. If you

989
00:37:44,366 --> 00:37:45,926
double-click on the text on

990
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:47,253
the text itself it brings up the

991
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:49,273
text dialog box and you’ve got lots

992
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:51,455
of options for whether it aligns in

993
00:37:51,466 --> 00:37:53,177
the center or in the middle so that’s

994
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:55,536
all kind of handy too. There we go

995
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,210
so shed, pop that there, escape from

996
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,089
the block so I’m editing the block

997
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,540
at the moment in the `Block List`

998
00:38:04,266 --> 00:38:06,006
click on that and then you can see

999
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,313
it’s got shed at an angle, there we

1000
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,540
go. So those are your three entities

1001
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,379
What I wanted to show you

1002
00:38:14,366 --> 00:38:16,886
next is very quickly is layers. Layers

1003
00:38:16,933 --> 00:38:18,313
is a really really good way of

1004
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:20,943
organising different information. So you have

1005
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:23,066
one layer for areas, one layer for

1006
00:38:23,066 --> 00:38:25,586
structures, another layer for plants or trees

1007
00:38:25,933 --> 00:38:27,373
you get the idea so you can

1008
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,542
organize it by different layers and

1009
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:30,721
then you can give different colors to

1010
00:38:30,733 --> 00:38:32,293
each layer as well, which again helps

1011
00:38:32,366 --> 00:38:34,286
with organising all the different elements

1012
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,230
There is on my GitHub website, you

1013
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,093
can download a template so you can

1014
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,840
just click down here and download the

1015
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:45,463
zip and then open up that file

1016
00:38:46,066 --> 00:38:48,226
and it will give

1017
00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:50,333
you this which is a list

1018
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:52,073
of all the layers and it’s also

1019
00:38:52,066 --> 00:38:54,136
got a handy little legend which I’ve premade

1020
00:38:54,133 --> 00:38:55,513
here as well, as a block

1021
00:38:56,466 --> 00:38:58,446
And I’ll be using this when I’m

1022
00:38:58,466 --> 00:39:01,766
going through the different examples too

1023
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:07,106
And then finally we’ve got the mods, four

1024
00:39:07,133 --> 00:39:10,193
different modifications to make. I’ll just go

1025
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:10,916
through them with you

1026
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,350
So here we go, mods you’ve got

1027
00:39:14,366 --> 00:39:16,736
four different types. Now this example is

1028
00:39:16,733 --> 00:39:20,633
actually taken from a real world example

1029
00:39:20,966 --> 00:39:23,996
of a gabion. Gabions are those wire

1030
00:39:23,966 --> 00:39:25,796
cages with stones in. And it’s a

1031
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:29,496
gabion horseshoe shape that I’m creating for the

1032
00:39:29,566 --> 00:39:31,966
local primary school. It’s like a seating

1033
00:39:31,966 --> 00:39:32,266
area

1034
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:34,073
but a kind of sheltered seating area

1035
00:39:34,466 --> 00:39:36,566
So I’ll just go through how

1036
00:39:36,566 --> 00:39:37,646
I’ve created it

1037
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,240
On the center point

1038
00:39:44,566 --> 00:39:47,236
I create a circle as the first thing

1039
00:39:47,866 --> 00:39:49,996
and the modification tools are under this

1040
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,870
menu over here. Ahhh, modification tools you’ve

1041
00:39:53,866 --> 00:39:57,076
already seen the the dynamite stick, so

1042
00:39:57,066 --> 00:39:58,686
select the element

1043
00:39:58,766 --> 00:40:00,446
that you want to modify

1044
00:40:00,466 --> 00:40:03,016
and I’m going to use offset

1045
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:04,443
I think which is this one

1046
00:40:04,466 --> 00:40:06,926
here `Offset (with Distance)`

1047
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,170
Okay it’s just 0.5 metres

1048
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:11,306
that’s how wide it is, I might make

1049
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:13,818
a little bit narrower

1050
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,660
0.4, 0.3 metres

1051
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:16,026
say

1052
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,419
there we go, you get the idea

1053
00:40:21,033 --> 00:40:23,793
Yeah, 0.3 metres, 30 centimetres

1054
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:27,503
and there we go that’s an offset

1055
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,480
and you can offset it either way

1056
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:33,883
Okay? Now I’ll take that shape and I

1057
00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:36,656
want to put two lines on to

1058
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,379
cut into it, so I’m going to

1059
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,410
draw one line on one side and a

1060
00:40:40,433 --> 00:40:44,243
mirror onto the other side and

1061
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:44,863
let’s do that

1062
00:40:45,266 --> 00:40:48,038
Hit escape to go back, line tool, draw

1063
00:40:48,033 --> 00:40:50,193
from the centre, draw out here

1064
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:53,823
Hit escape again, go back, select it with

1065
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:56,413
the arrow tool, go to the modification

1066
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,750
tools and up here is the mirror

1067
00:41:01,033 --> 00:41:02,835
and then click on mirror and say you

1068
00:41:02,866 --> 00:41:06,744
want to here, that line there. And

1069
00:41:06,733 --> 00:41:08,473
I want to keep the original and

1070
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,936
I want to just flip it over. Bomf

1071
00:41:12,266 --> 00:41:13,668
There we go, so that’s the mirror tool

1072
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:14,776
so that’s really good if you’ve got

1073
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:17,676
any kind of symmetrical shapes that you

1074
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:19,586
want to create and you can

1075
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,879
mirror them. And now we go onto the

1076
00:41:21,866 --> 00:41:24,566
divide tool, this is always a great

1077
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:25,676
deal of fun so you can see

1078
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,929
what I’m trying to achieve here at

1079
00:41:26,933 --> 00:41:30,413
the end is to cut where

1080
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,570
those lines intersect

1081
00:41:31,566 --> 00:41:34,956
So go back, hit escape key

1082
00:41:35,366 --> 00:41:36,566
to go back to the arrow tool

1083
00:41:36,666 --> 00:41:39,426
modification tools and then it’s the scissor

1084
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:41,383
tool, which is great, nice

1085
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:45,506
and easy and for the inner circle

1086
00:41:45,566 --> 00:41:47,876
click on the divide tool, the red pair of scissors

1087
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,740
click on the inner circle, intersection

1088
00:41:51,733 --> 00:41:54,013
and intersection

1089
00:41:55,366 --> 00:41:58,156
select that segment, click delete, there you

1090
00:41:58,166 --> 00:42:00,896
go. And a really handy hint

1091
00:42:00,933 --> 00:42:02,913
if you are doing any drawing at all

1092
00:42:03,433 --> 00:42:05,413
with the line tool, rather than have

1093
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,980
to redraw the line, using the snap

1094
00:42:08,066 --> 00:42:10,496
the automatic snap, you select the end

1095
00:42:10,466 --> 00:42:12,176
of the line and it will snap automatically

1096
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,139
to the intersection with that circle. So

1097
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,876
that’s very often the kind of quickest

1098
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:21,230
way of creating the shape is to

1099
00:42:21,233 --> 00:42:23,783
use your existing lines and let the

1100
00:42:23,766 --> 00:42:25,686
snap do the work for you, like

1101
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,039
that and there we go, we’ve got horseshoe

1102
00:42:28,033 --> 00:42:30,673
shape. I’ll turn that to make life

1103
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:32,886
easier I’m going to turn this into a

1104
00:42:32,933 --> 00:42:34,853
block and I’ll

1105
00:42:35,533 --> 00:42:38,113
select all the items, all the elements

1106
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,030
in there, `Block > Create Block From Selection`

1107
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,950
click in the centre

1108
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:46,503
and I’m going to call that, oh

1109
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,120
I don’t know, horsehoe or something

1110
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:50,595
And there we go, we’ve got a block

1111
00:42:50,633 --> 00:42:53,134
and just makes that easier, creating a

1112
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:54,846
block makes it easy to rotate so that

1113
00:42:54,866 --> 00:42:57,266
you can fine tune it. So select

1114
00:42:57,266 --> 00:43:00,296
that, go to the `Property Editor` and

1115
00:43:00,266 --> 00:43:01,826
I want to give it an angle of

1116
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,390
I don’t know, 45 degrees or

1117
00:43:04,433 --> 00:43:06,293
56 degrees why not 56

1118
00:43:06,266 --> 00:43:08,306
degrees and there we go it’s an

1119
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:09,503
angle of 56 degrees

1120
00:43:09,633 --> 00:43:11,523
for the horseshoe shape. So there we

1121
00:43:11,533 --> 00:43:13,813
go that’s how we're using these four

1122
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,520
different modifications to create a horseshoe shape

1123
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,633
gabion wall seating area

1124
00:43:19,633 --> 00:43:22,000
And finally I just want to talk to you about

1125
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,879
the blocks that we have our disposal

1126
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,500
there’s three different types of blocks that

1127
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,660
I’ve got, there’s forest garden plants

1128
00:43:30,133 --> 00:43:32,593
again you can download these zip files

1129
00:43:32,933 --> 00:43:34,733
native wild plants, this is only has

1130
00:43:34,733 --> 00:43:35,903
a couple of plants in at the moment

1131
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,160
and this project I’m gonna be working

1132
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:38,816
on, and then garden furniture which has

1133
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,810
got some useful garden furniture in it

1134
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,540
like benches and steps and stuff like

1135
00:43:42,566 --> 00:43:44,786
that and people. So I’ll just show

1136
00:43:44,766 --> 00:43:47,166
you forest garden plants first of all

1137
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,310
So if I click on open

1138
00:43:53,466 --> 00:43:56,226
blocks, forest garden and then that’s divided

1139
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,273
into five different sections and the forest

1140
00:43:58,266 --> 00:44:02,496
garden plants blocks, it’s incomplete but there’s

1141
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,509
a spreadsheet that I have created, I’ll

1142
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,570
just show you the page first of all

1143
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:10,146
there’s a spreadsheet I’ve created forest garden

1144
00:44:10,166 --> 00:44:14,966
bit.ly/forest-garden-spreadsheet and

1145
00:44:14,966 --> 00:44:16,286
this has a list of all the

1146
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,000
plants in this book and I’ve started

1147
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:21,343
to put all the plants into a

1148
00:44:21,366 --> 00:44:24,306
block list so I was doing it anyway

1149
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,250
for myself but you're more than welcome

1150
00:44:26,266 --> 00:44:27,496
to dip in and help them

1151
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:27,979
out, help

1152
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,360
yourself to any of the

1153
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:30,836
trees which are in there so I

1154
00:44:30,833 --> 00:44:33,893
don’t know there’s a Crataegus

1155
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,812
dilatata, whatever that is, click

1156
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,108
it out here so to

1157
00:44:40,133 --> 00:44:41,633
get a block out I’ll just show you that

1158
00:44:41,633 --> 00:44:44,444
again, select it from the list

1159
00:44:44,566 --> 00:44:46,336
the block that you want and

1160
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:48,133
then click on that icon here which

1161
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:51,046
is `Insert Block` and it gives you it out

1162
00:44:51,033 --> 00:44:54,843
here. And there you go, Broadleaf Hawthorn, so

1163
00:44:54,866 --> 00:44:57,656
I’ll copy that, go back to my

1164
00:44:57,633 --> 00:44:58,353
mods

1165
00:44:59,766 --> 00:45:01,896
paste it in, there we have a

1166
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:05,017
Broadleaf Hawthorn and there’s, you’ve

1167
00:45:05,033 --> 00:45:06,299
got quite a choice of quite a

1168
00:45:06,266 --> 00:45:09,356
few plants there. And

1169
00:45:09,366 --> 00:45:14,226
then finally for garden furniture, blocks, furniture

1170
00:45:14,266 --> 00:45:16,966
again you can download this. This has

1171
00:45:16,966 --> 00:45:19,306
got useful things like I don’t know

1172
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,080
a deck chair so you can copy

1173
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,240
and then just copy and paste it

1174
00:45:24,266 --> 00:45:25,916
in and then we’ve got a Broadleaf

1175
00:45:25,966 --> 00:45:28,096
Hawthorn and a deck chair, how

1176
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:28,670
lovely is that?

1177
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,450
Okay thank you very much for watching

1178
00:45:32,433 --> 00:45:33,753
see you in the next section which

1179
00:45:33,766 --> 00:45:36,406
is about real world examples, I’ll be doing

1180
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,920
a walk through applying all these techniques

1181
00:45:38,933 --> 00:45:41,873
and using these blocks in creating two

1182
00:45:41,866 --> 00:45:43,200
different types of garden, thanks

1183
00:45:43,233 --> 00:45:46,667
Greetings and welcome to section four of my online

1184
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:49,426
class ‘CAD for Gardeners’ and here I’m

1185
00:45:49,466 --> 00:45:50,066
going be looking at

1186
00:45:50,066 --> 00:45:52,766
a couple of real world examples. First

1187
00:45:52,766 --> 00:45:54,326
of all I’m looking at an

1188
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,770
average sized garden in the UK

1189
00:45:57,233 --> 00:45:58,823
so that you can get an idea

1190
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,630
of scale and how that compares to

1191
00:46:00,766 --> 00:46:03,676
compares with an acre which is a

1192
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,490
traditional UK area of land

1193
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,750
Then I’ll be looking at using a

1194
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:10,203
satellite photograph

1195
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,779
a screenshot of a satellite photograph

1196
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,390
as a background for a CAD

1197
00:46:15,366 --> 00:46:18,606
plan which works better with the larger

1198
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:21,006
garden and then the actual

1199
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,580
gardens themselves and these are real clients

1200
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,000
that I’ve had, ones about an acre for

1201
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,680
the garden and ones a town

1202
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:30,833
garden. So the average garden in the

1203
00:46:30,866 --> 00:46:33,432
UK is a 188 square metres

1204
00:46:33,433 --> 00:46:35,867
apparently, according to the Office of

1205
00:46:35,866 --> 00:46:39,226
National Statistics. In London that’s 140

1206
00:46:39,233 --> 00:46:42,233
140 square metres and that compares

1207
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:44,866
to an acre which is 4,000 square metres

1208
00:46:44,866 --> 00:46:45,833
and you can see here

1209
00:46:46,166 --> 00:46:49,316
in this image that there is the

1210
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,500
one acre, the one on the left-hand

1211
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,760
side and then this garden on the

1212
00:46:51,766 --> 00:46:53,086
right-hand side. Should be able to

1213
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:54,606
this is a screenshot that

1214
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,130
I did so you can just see

1215
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,080
how they compare and forest

1216
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,940
gardens do tend to be a

1217
00:47:02,933 --> 00:47:04,493
bit larger than your

1218
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,380
average garden, mostly because they have

1219
00:47:07,566 --> 00:47:09,066
more trees and more people

1220
00:47:09,066 --> 00:47:10,956
think about them in

1221
00:47:10,966 --> 00:47:12,556
that way but you can have a

1222
00:47:12,566 --> 00:47:13,316
forest garden

1223
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:15,463
in a small garden, it’s much more

1224
00:47:15,633 --> 00:47:18,573
about the process and the principles than

1225
00:47:18,566 --> 00:47:20,486
it is about the actual size

1226
00:47:20,466 --> 00:47:23,316
of the garden. So now looking at

1227
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:25,253
a satellite photograph this is a

1228
00:47:25,266 --> 00:47:26,406
3D version but we're going to use

1229
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,010
the 2D plan. There’s three steps

1230
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,299
to using a satellite photograph as a

1231
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,467
background for

1232
00:47:33,466 --> 00:47:35,716
your CAD plan. First one is to take

1233
00:47:35,733 --> 00:47:38,883
a screenshot, then we work out the

1234
00:47:38,866 --> 00:47:41,296
metres per pixel and then we import

1235
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,940
that image into QCAD. I’ll just quickly go

1236
00:47:43,933 --> 00:47:45,523
through that process now and I’ll be

1237
00:47:45,533 --> 00:47:47,933
going through this again later for

1238
00:47:47,933 --> 00:47:50,093
both examples. First I’ll take a

1239
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,900
screenshot. Make sure it’s the highest resolution

1240
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,490
possible and

1241
00:47:53,633 --> 00:47:56,753
then be sure to include the

1242
00:47:56,766 --> 00:47:58,986
scale in metres, you can just about

1243
00:47:58,966 --> 00:48:00,766
see that down in the bottom right-hand corner

1244
00:48:01,466 --> 00:48:03,056
and save it as a good quality

1245
00:48:03,066 --> 00:48:07,956
JPEG. Then you measure the pixel length

1246
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,790
of the metres scale, so zooming in

1247
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,650
here, that’s 5 metres that scale at

1248
00:48:13,633 --> 00:48:15,333
the bottom and you can see it’s

1249
00:48:15,333 --> 00:48:17,823
106 pixels, so metres

1250
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,230
per pixel, 5 metres divided by

1251
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:22,512
106 pixels gives you

1252
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:24,604
0.047 blah de blah de blah

1253
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,699
metres per pixel and that is your

1254
00:48:27,966 --> 00:48:29,706
call it image scale factor, that’s how

1255
00:48:29,733 --> 00:48:31,323
much you need to scale the image down

1256
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:33,946
because when you import an image

1257
00:48:33,966 --> 00:48:36,966
image into QCAD, it imports it at

1258
00:48:36,966 --> 00:48:39,516
1 metre per pixel whereas actually we’ve

1259
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,200
got 0.047 metres per

1260
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,690
pixel here. So that’s the reason for

1261
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,470
scaling it and it’s really really important to

1262
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:48,026
do that otherwise all your

1263
00:48:48,233 --> 00:48:49,193
measurements will be out

1264
00:48:50,866 --> 00:48:52,576
And then we go into QCAD

1265
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,390
`File > Import > Select > Select All`

1266
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:59,023
View the `Property Editor`, so that’s

1267
00:48:59,033 --> 00:49:00,173
under the `File` menu and this is

1268
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:02,146
where you're bringing in the image, view

1269
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:03,246
the `Property Editor`

1270
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,120
which I’ve actually got locked now on the

1271
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:09,520
right-hand side and you want to put

1272
00:49:09,533 --> 00:49:11,153
in the width and the height factor

1273
00:49:11,166 --> 00:49:13,266
you can just see down there, there’s

1274
00:49:13,266 --> 00:49:14,766
a width factor for the

1275
00:49:14,766 --> 00:49:16,686
image and the height factor and

1276
00:49:16,733 --> 00:49:20,090
in there we enter that number

1277
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,812
0.047 that’s a metre

1278
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,896
that’s the image scale factor that’s metres

1279
00:49:23,933 --> 00:49:24,606
per pixel

1280
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,360
So enter them in there

1281
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,210
and then that image gets scaled down

1282
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:33,203
Cool, so that’s quite straightforward steps but

1283
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,140
can be really really useful having that

1284
00:49:36,133 --> 00:49:38,743
satellite photograph in a CAD plan because

1285
00:49:38,766 --> 00:49:41,556
it’s really handy guide to have. Obviously

1286
00:49:41,866 --> 00:49:43,576
you want to be, you’ve got got to

1287
00:49:43,566 --> 00:49:44,736
be aware of there’s copyright issues

1288
00:49:44,766 --> 00:49:47,136
you can't use this commercially etc etc

1289
00:49:47,233 --> 00:49:49,813
but it’s handy to know how

1290
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:51,543
to do it. Okay so I’m going

1291
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:54,353
to jump straight over into creating the

1292
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:58,926
garden acre example. Jump over into QCAD

1293
00:49:59,366 --> 00:50:01,302
I’ll quickly show you how to add a

1294
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,362
template so the first thing that we

1295
00:50:03,366 --> 00:50:04,274
need to do is to go to

1296
00:50:04,266 --> 00:50:04,896
my GitHub

1297
00:50:04,966 --> 00:50:07,636
page github.com/growdigital/template

1298
00:50:07,633 --> 00:50:11,323
and download that

1299
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:15,023
template, so click on `Code`, `Download ZIP`. Once

1300
00:50:15,033 --> 00:50:17,403
that has finished downloading go to your

1301
00:50:17,433 --> 00:50:18,663
download folder

1302
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,270
and unzip it

1303
00:50:22,433 --> 00:50:24,953
unzip it there, I’m going to rename it

1304
00:50:24,966 --> 00:50:27,456
template just to keep things tidy

1305
00:50:28,666 --> 00:50:31,726
Going to cut that and I have created

1306
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,230
in my documents folder I have

1307
00:50:34,233 --> 00:50:36,723
created a QCAD folder and that’s

1308
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,069
where I’m gonna put my templates so

1309
00:50:39,166 --> 00:50:41,836
paste that in there. Now I need

1310
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:43,303
to go back into QCAD

1311
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:49,936
and then under `Edit > Application Preferences > File

1312
00:50:50,266 --> 00:50:53,236
and Templates` I need to add that

1313
00:50:53,233 --> 00:50:57,433
folder, so go into my Documents folder

1314
00:50:58,966 --> 00:51:02,146
into QCAD, into template and then

1315
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:04,776
choose that one, click `OK` it says

1316
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,050
you need to restart so we will restart

1317
00:51:07,033 --> 00:51:07,573
QCAD

1318
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,940
and now when you go `File > New

1319
00:51:11,933 --> 00:51:12,983
From Template`

1320
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,450
you will see that you have the

1321
00:51:16,466 --> 00:51:20,606
default folder here, click on `Template`

1322
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:23,283
`Create New Drawing` there we go and

1323
00:51:23,266 --> 00:51:26,386
it’s got all the layers in there

1324
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,020
as well. So I’m just going to save

1325
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,560
that first of all into the garden

1326
00:51:29,566 --> 00:51:34,186
acre folder, save as and

1327
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,929
and, where are we? We're here so

1328
00:51:36,966 --> 00:51:40,326
call that garden-acre and save

1329
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,890
that in there. The next thing I

1330
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,310
want to do is to bring in

1331
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:46,936
that satellite photograph so I’ve opened up

1332
00:51:46,966 --> 00:51:49,576
GNU Image Manipulation Program which is

1333
00:51:49,566 --> 00:51:52,536
like Photoshop, because I’m on Linux I

1334
00:51:52,566 --> 00:51:53,946
don’t have Photoshop anymore

1335
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,790
use the marquee tool and I’ll select

1336
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:01,070
that area there and that then gives

1337
00:52:01,066 --> 00:52:03,376
me down here, gives us the size

1338
00:52:03,366 --> 00:52:05,286
of a 114 so that’s

1339
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:08,510
10 metres divided by a 114

1340
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:12,130
pixels and that’s metres per pixel

1341
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,509
so 10 metres divided by 114

1342
00:52:14,533 --> 00:52:17,293
is 0.08771…

1343
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:19,583
etc so I’ll just

1344
00:52:19,666 --> 00:52:22,276
save that number and then I’ll use

1345
00:52:22,266 --> 00:52:24,306
that number when I scale down the

1346
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:27,453
image. So go back into CAD, go

1347
00:52:27,466 --> 00:52:32,476
`File > Import` garden acre and satellite, so

1348
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,580
bring that straight in

1349
00:52:36,033 --> 00:52:37,593
oops, okay, and you can see it’s

1350
00:52:37,566 --> 00:52:40,146
really really really really really big. What

1351
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:41,366
I want to do is to put

1352
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:43,286
that into the xSatellite layer, so it’s

1353
00:52:43,266 --> 00:52:46,356
right at the back, that layer down the bottom

1354
00:52:46,366 --> 00:52:48,408
this is the reason

1355
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,868
for having layers is that you

1356
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,486
can just put different stuff on different

1357
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,180
layers and keep it locked up and

1358
00:52:53,166 --> 00:52:54,816
tidied away. So now I

1359
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:56,633
need to scale this image down

1360
00:52:56,666 --> 00:52:58,226
to the right metres per pixel, it’s

1361
00:52:58,233 --> 00:52:59,613
being brought in at 1 meter per pixel

1362
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,490
and I need it to be much

1363
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:04,064
considerably smaller, so make sure it’s selected

1364
00:53:05,733 --> 00:53:07,231
and then I go to that width

1365
00:53:07,233 --> 00:53:09,305
factor and the height factor, let me

1366
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:10,653
just pull it over here a little

1367
00:53:10,633 --> 00:53:12,973
bit so you can see, so width

1368
00:53:12,966 --> 00:53:15,966
factor I’ll place in the metres per

1369
00:53:15,966 --> 00:53:19,296
pixel which are calculated from the Photoshop

1370
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:22,330
file and I’ll paste in that number there

1371
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,310
and there we go that’s much more

1372
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:30,040
to scale, okay. Another handy little hint

1373
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:31,893
quite often when you bring in new

1374
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,970
images and new elements they’ll sit on

1375
00:53:33,966 --> 00:53:36,126
top of everything else so if you

1376
00:53:36,133 --> 00:53:38,773
go to `Modify` and then the `Draw Order`

1377
00:53:38,766 --> 00:53:40,326
you can send it to the

1378
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:41,863
back and that means that you then

1379
00:53:41,933 --> 00:53:43,403
get to see other bits and pieces

1380
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,990
like the legend I’ve got down here.

1381
00:53:45,666 --> 00:53:47,916
So, I’ve created a template, got the

1382
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,941
satellite image in and now I’m going to

1383
00:53:49,933 --> 00:53:53,145
create the boundary, so back into QCAD

1384
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:55,476
click on the boundary layer because

1385
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,248
this is where I’m going to be

1386
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:58,336
drawing the boundary and this is a

1387
00:53:58,333 --> 00:54:00,313
lovely house, I just I do like

1388
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:02,933
it, it’s a nice little job

1389
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,230
I wanted to do a a water garden

1390
00:54:06,633 --> 00:54:09,453
And I’m going to use `Snap Free`

1391
00:54:10,233 --> 00:54:11,883
yep, and then I’m using the

1392
00:54:11,866 --> 00:54:16,156
line tool here and `Snap Free` and

1393
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:17,846
then I’m going to trace an outline

1394
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:19,633
and it’s this field you know this

1395
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,410
field here, I’m going

1396
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,900
to trace an outline around it. It’s

1397
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:23,800
not going to be particularly

1398
00:54:23,866 --> 00:54:26,296
accurate or particularly pretty but just gives

1399
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,250
you an idea. I could be

1400
00:54:28,266 --> 00:54:30,786
using curves for this as well. I

1401
00:54:30,766 --> 00:54:32,317
could be doing it accurately too!

1402
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:38,060
There we go and then `Snap Auto` because I

1403
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,385
want to snap onto the end of

1404
00:54:39,366 --> 00:54:41,405
that bit there okay. There we go

1405
00:54:41,466 --> 00:54:43,386
hit escape go back to the arrow

1406
00:54:43,366 --> 00:54:46,606
tool. Ah what you can do brilliantly

1407
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:48,466
really nice little feature you can lock

1408
00:54:48,466 --> 00:54:50,656
layers so I’m going to lock that satellite layer

1409
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,490
and then go back to my boundary layer

1410
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,620
This means I don’t pick up

1411
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,879
the satellite photo by accident

1412
00:54:56,866 --> 00:54:58,726
Now we’ve got that if I

1413
00:54:58,733 --> 00:55:00,953
hide, you click on the eye

1414
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,770
it hides a layer so I’ll just

1415
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:04,596
hide that layer and you can see

1416
00:55:04,633 --> 00:55:06,793
that’s the line that we’ve drawn around

1417
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,420
it. So now

1418
00:55:09,766 --> 00:55:11,266
if I double-click on it, it selects

1419
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,375
it, it gives you the

1420
00:55:12,366 --> 00:55:15,337
total length here but it doesn't

1421
00:55:15,366 --> 00:55:18,636
give you the area so what I’m

1422
00:55:18,633 --> 00:55:19,833
going to do is make it into

1423
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:21,543
a polyline which is what I showed you

1424
00:55:21,533 --> 00:55:23,603
earlier on so double-click

1425
00:55:25,033 --> 00:55:30,313
selects all the items, `Draw > Polyline >

1426
00:55:30,333 --> 00:55:31,683
Polyline From Selection`

1427
00:55:33,733 --> 00:55:35,473
And now when I click on it

1428
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:38,013
it gives us an area so that’s

1429
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,640
3,127m²

1430
00:55:40,633 --> 00:55:42,643
so basically that’s three quarters of an

1431
00:55:42,666 --> 00:55:45,126
acre which is a fair sized, nice

1432
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:46,093
sized garden

1433
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,549
I’ll bring the satellite back so we

1434
00:55:49,566 --> 00:55:51,486
can see. So next I’m going to

1435
00:55:51,466 --> 00:55:52,606
put some paths in

1436
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,980
and I’ll just do this on

1437
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,859
the areas. I’m just going to use

1438
00:55:58,866 --> 00:56:00,093
a line tool, I’m not

1439
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:02,332
going do anything really fancy, so line tool

1440
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:05,646
this one here and I know that

1441
00:56:05,633 --> 00:56:08,513
there’s an entrance here, I’ll snap onto

1442
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,594
the entity so that I know that

1443
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,125
it snaps actually onto that line, I think

1444
00:56:13,133 --> 00:56:15,046
the path is around about there and

1445
00:56:15,066 --> 00:56:20,092
I go `Snap Auto` turns it off and

1446
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,490
I think they want a

1447
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,240
path going around here

1448
00:56:24,433 --> 00:56:24,854
round the top

1449
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,580
and there’s another exit out there, so

1450
00:56:29,566 --> 00:56:32,836
`Snap onto Entity` to snap up to

1451
00:56:32,866 --> 00:56:34,120
there, there we go

1452
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:37,883
We now have a path going around

1453
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,727
the edge. Turn off the satellite so

1454
00:56:39,766 --> 00:56:41,146
you can see the path. What I

1455
00:56:41,133 --> 00:56:44,103
will do is to offset this so

1456
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,450
you get much more the idea of

1457
00:56:45,466 --> 00:56:47,356
a path, so using the offset tool

1458
00:56:47,633 --> 00:56:49,223
you can draw one line for your

1459
00:56:49,233 --> 00:56:51,093
path and then you can offset it

1460
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,580
both sides or one side and

1461
00:56:54,566 --> 00:56:55,286
then it creates

1462
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,374
the path itself but the size of

1463
00:56:57,366 --> 00:56:58,682
your path depends on how wide

1464
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:00,196
you want it but if it’s about

1465
00:57:00,233 --> 00:57:02,783
a metre, a metre’s a nice big comfortable path

1466
00:57:03,033 --> 00:57:04,473
down to about 0.4 metres

1467
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,940
for a single person to walk along

1468
00:57:05,966 --> 00:57:07,166
so it depends where the path is and

1469
00:57:07,166 --> 00:57:11,096
how you’re using it and so let’s hit escape

1470
00:57:12,133 --> 00:57:15,466
go into the modification tools and then offset

1471
00:57:15,966 --> 00:57:18,846
and I’ll offset 0.3 metres

1472
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,580
on each side I’ll just zoom in

1473
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,880
so offset it on that side and

1474
00:57:23,866 --> 00:57:27,196
offset it on that side, okay and

1475
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,359
then I’m going to delete the middle

1476
00:57:29,366 --> 00:57:30,476
bit. And then you’ve got a nice

1477
00:57:30,466 --> 00:57:32,626
little path. Now you could do this using

1478
00:57:32,633 --> 00:57:34,553
the NURBS tool as well. Then next

1479
00:57:34,566 --> 00:57:35,556
up, I want to

1480
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,910
put the trees in so let’s go

1481
00:57:37,966 --> 00:57:40,816
and grab some trees from the forest

1482
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,770
garden blocks. Go back up here, blocks

1483
00:57:43,766 --> 00:57:48,296
forest garden canopy and let’s get a selection

1484
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:52,350
of trees. Cornus capitata, Cornel…

1485
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,430
Cornus capitata, click that button there

1486
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,790
check that one Bentham's Cornel, Cornus kousa

1487
00:57:59,933 --> 00:58:03,623
just escape that, Cornus kousa, click on

1488
00:58:03,633 --> 00:58:07,773
the insert block button, it’s a Chinese Dogwood

1489
00:58:08,633 --> 00:58:10,733
I’ve got to have a hawthorn

1490
00:58:12,766 --> 00:58:14,746
Crataegus schraderiana

1491
00:58:17,566 --> 00:58:19,936
insert block, Blue Hawthorn

1492
00:58:21,033 --> 00:58:23,613
and then I always always always have to

1493
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,490
have a Sweet Chestnut, actually a Sweet

1494
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,169
Chestnut won't work because I know it’s

1495
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:30,446
a damp, oh I’ll put a Sweet Chestnut on anyway

1496
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,049
let’s pretend it’s not damp there, Sweet

1497
00:58:33,066 --> 00:58:35,236
Chestnuts don’t like heavy clay soils

1498
00:58:35,266 --> 00:58:36,106
and I know it’s a heavy

1499
00:58:36,133 --> 00:58:37,363
clay soil there so it won't do

1500
00:58:37,366 --> 00:58:39,376
very well. I’ll just cut them

1501
00:58:41,566 --> 00:58:43,246
and I’ll go over to the tree

1502
00:58:43,266 --> 00:58:47,016
layer in the `Layers List` and

1503
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,180
then paste and there we go, look

1504
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,419
at that, fantastic and then you move the

1505
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,870
trees around so that they’re in

1506
00:58:53,933 --> 00:58:56,483
the right position

1507
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,630
they've got enough spacing and there’s enough

1508
00:58:58,666 --> 00:59:00,586
there’s enough spacing around between

1509
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,069
the trees and enough light getting through

1510
00:59:02,066 --> 00:59:04,556
to the bottom canopy floor layer

1511
00:59:06,866 --> 00:59:09,896
Okay now I’m going to put

1512
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:13,920
in some hedgerows, some hedges so let’s

1513
00:59:13,966 --> 00:59:14,836
open up

1514
00:59:16,133 --> 00:59:18,863
the shrub document from the forest garden

1515
00:59:18,866 --> 00:59:19,556
plants

1516
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,506
and we’ll have a hedge of

1517
00:59:25,966 --> 00:59:28,966
Ligustrum vulgare

1518
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:32,753
this is a Wild Privet really really

1519
00:59:32,766 --> 00:59:35,999
good wildlife plant, Privet, Ligustrum vulgare

1520
00:59:38,133 --> 00:59:39,423
and we go back here and paste

1521
00:59:39,433 --> 00:59:39,793
it in

1522
00:59:40,933 --> 00:59:44,173
and this forms part of the

1523
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,580
design side of things is what

1524
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,150
height windbreak you should have

1525
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:51,636
So on the northside you can see, down

1526
00:59:51,633 --> 00:59:53,643
here you’ve got north-east-west and

1527
00:59:53,633 --> 00:59:55,523
south, on the north side you want

1528
00:59:55,533 --> 00:59:58,770
the tallest wind breaks along there and

1529
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:01,060
also because that is a road

1530
01:00:01,066 --> 01:00:02,806
there as well you want a

1531
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,026
big tall I would have put a

1532
01:00:05,033 --> 01:00:07,673
double thickness windbreak along there, you're

1533
01:00:07,666 --> 01:00:09,526
not going to lose any light, you

1534
01:00:09,533 --> 01:00:11,003
get much more protection and you make

1535
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,640
it thick and right cut down on

1536
01:00:13,666 --> 01:00:14,896
the amount of road noise that you

1537
01:00:14,866 --> 01:00:18,226
get. So Ligustrum vulgare is actually

1538
01:00:18,233 --> 01:00:19,701
not that tall so I wouldn't have

1539
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:21,220
it, 1.5 metres

1540
01:00:21,233 --> 01:00:22,463
I thought it would be bigger

1541
01:00:22,466 --> 01:00:24,266
than that, to 1.5 to

1542
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:25,140
2 metres

1543
01:00:26,933 --> 01:00:28,283
so that’s a kind of hedge you'd

1544
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,130
have on the south side. So the

1545
01:00:30,133 --> 01:00:33,013
most valuable sunlight comes from the south

1546
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,460
and the west that the air has

1547
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:36,696
had a time to warm up in

1548
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,919
the afternoon so that the afternoon

1549
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:41,690
sunlight is more valuable, there’s more photosynthesis

1550
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,080
apparently than in the

1551
01:00:43,066 --> 01:00:44,926
morning. I want to put them onto the

1552
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:45,683
shrub layer

1553
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,330
I put one there

1554
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,830
and then one there

1555
01:00:52,666 --> 01:00:53,386
okay

1556
01:00:58,866 --> 01:01:00,636
And then to make it a windbreak

1557
01:01:00,633 --> 01:01:02,463
hedge all that I do

1558
01:01:04,666 --> 01:01:05,926
it’s three metres diameter

1559
01:01:07,066 --> 01:01:08,416
all that I’m going do now is

1560
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,730
to draw a line between them, right

1561
01:01:11,733 --> 01:01:13,323
in the centre, the central points, it

1562
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:15,553
should automatically snap to the reference point

1563
01:01:15,533 --> 01:01:16,373
which is in the middle

1564
01:01:17,766 --> 01:01:22,230
from one to the other. Hit escape and

1565
01:01:22,233 --> 01:01:23,529
now I’m going to use the offset

1566
01:01:23,533 --> 01:01:25,393
tool to put the two sides of

1567
01:01:25,366 --> 01:01:27,346
the hedge on. So the same

1568
01:01:27,366 --> 01:01:29,406
kind of principle as creating a path

1569
01:01:29,666 --> 01:01:33,446
so modification tools, offset tool and I

1570
01:01:33,466 --> 01:01:35,626
know that the width of the Privet

1571
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,760
hedge will be 3 metres diameter

1572
01:01:37,766 --> 01:01:40,106
or 3 metres width, so it’s

1573
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,020
1.5 metres for one side

1574
01:01:42,033 --> 01:01:43,743
1.5 metres for the other side

1575
01:01:44,733 --> 01:01:46,623
So a distance 1.5

1576
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:50,923
bomp and that one bomp

1577
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:54,333
Delete the middle one now

1578
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:55,953
There you go, we now have

1579
01:01:57,166 --> 01:01:58,516
a windbreak. And then I would

1580
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,140
do wind breaks around the

1581
01:02:01,133 --> 01:02:03,263
edges. A big part of the design

1582
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,520
is figuring out how the different areas

1583
01:02:05,533 --> 01:02:07,573
are going to be used and a

1584
01:02:07,566 --> 01:02:09,246
fundamental element of that design which I

1585
01:02:09,266 --> 01:02:13,676
cover in my design class is creating

1586
01:02:13,733 --> 01:02:16,193
the areas through the use of paths

1587
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:17,133
So you create

1588
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,249
the paths first, you create the structure

1589
01:02:19,233 --> 01:02:21,333
of the garden first of all and

1590
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:22,863
then you can bring in the different

1591
01:02:22,866 --> 01:02:24,936
planting around and the features around that

1592
01:02:26,366 --> 01:02:28,796
okay so what I would do

1593
01:02:29,566 --> 01:02:31,456
after this I would create

1594
01:02:31,466 --> 01:02:33,386
different windbreaks all the way around so

1595
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,660
you would always want to have

1596
01:02:34,666 --> 01:02:36,856
windbreaks surrounding your garden to reduce

1597
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:38,873
the amount of turbulence particularly with

1598
01:02:38,866 --> 01:02:41,296
the Climate Emergency because there’s going to

1599
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,980
be more and more extreme weather events

1600
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,799
There we go and that’s that

1601
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,710
one done. And now onto creating the

1602
01:02:48,766 --> 01:02:50,056
garden town

1603
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:53,013
So as I said before, the satellite

1604
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,590
really is just a rough guide. I’ll

1605
01:02:54,633 --> 01:02:56,433
do it from the satellite now but what

1606
01:02:56,433 --> 01:02:57,543
you want to be doing is creating

1607
01:02:57,533 --> 01:02:59,213
your plan from actual measurements on the

1608
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:02,173
ground and just get general information from

1609
01:03:02,166 --> 01:03:03,718
the maps, okay, so this is what

1610
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,837
we're going to be doing so let’s go

1611
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:08,086
and create a new file, save that

1612
01:03:08,066 --> 01:03:10,556
one, create a new file from template

1613
01:03:12,366 --> 01:03:14,556
And I’m going to save that as garden

1614
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:18,500
town, okay, go up the level, garden town

1615
01:03:18,533 --> 01:03:20,873
and this is garden town,

1616
01:03:20,866 --> 01:03:21,346
garden-town

1617
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:26,303
great stuff then go over to

1618
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:30,083
my image bitmap editor, zoom down

1619
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:30,610
here

1620
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:35,923
Use a rectangular marquee tool and select that

1621
01:03:38,166 --> 01:03:39,396
and you can see that the width

1622
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,990
the marquee is a 110 pixels

1623
01:03:40,966 --> 01:03:44,536
so that is 5 metres and

1624
01:03:44,566 --> 01:03:46,246
110 pixels that’s

1625
01:03:46,266 --> 01:03:48,816
5 divided by 110 gives

1626
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,080
you your metres per pixel, so

1627
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,410
5 divided by 110

1628
01:03:55,766 --> 01:03:56,516
gives you that.

1629
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:00,999
Lovely. And now go back into QCAD

1630
01:04:01,633 --> 01:04:08,383
select the satellite layer, file import and

1631
01:04:09,133 --> 01:04:10,123
it’s going to make me go all the

1632
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,420
way back obviously

1633
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:15,346
examples, garden town, satellite

1634
01:04:17,133 --> 01:04:17,913
pop that in there

1635
01:04:19,733 --> 01:04:21,323
See, really really really big it is

1636
01:04:22,433 --> 01:04:24,380
Let’s select it and then the width

1637
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,983
factor, whoops, I’ll just pop that up here

1638
01:04:26,966 --> 01:04:27,386
for you

1639
01:04:29,033 --> 01:04:31,403
that’s the width factor here, so paste

1640
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,930
in that value which is the metres

1641
01:04:32,933 --> 01:04:34,823
per pixel, paste that value in there

1642
01:04:35,633 --> 01:04:37,553
and you can see it shrinks right the

1643
01:04:37,566 --> 01:04:40,356
way down, weeee, that’s better, and now

1644
01:04:40,366 --> 01:04:42,586
it’s to scale and then just to

1645
01:04:42,566 --> 01:04:43,676
get it, can you see

1646
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:49,420
`Modify > Draw Order > Send to Back`

1647
01:04:50,533 --> 01:04:51,779
and then you can see

1648
01:04:51,766 --> 01:04:51,976
the

1649
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:56,840
compass, the legend there as well lovely

1650
01:04:56,866 --> 01:04:57,796
I’ll lock that layer

1651
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,680
So this is a friend's garden in

1652
01:05:01,933 --> 01:05:04,153
North London, I worked on a few

1653
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:04,853
years ago now

1654
01:05:06,633 --> 01:05:08,583
okay, going to pop the `Property Editor`

1655
01:05:08,566 --> 01:05:10,966
there and it’s this one here, so

1656
01:05:10,966 --> 01:05:12,226
I’m just going to do this really

1657
01:05:12,233 --> 01:05:15,323
really really basically so start off with

1658
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:18,963
the boundary so select the boundary layer

1659
01:05:20,066 --> 01:05:22,586
click on the line tool, this one

1660
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,220
the only one I ever use

1661
01:05:24,233 --> 01:05:27,131
`LI` and then we’ll just click

1662
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:34,179
click, click, click, click, and that’s it

1663
01:05:34,966 --> 01:05:36,406
double-click it and you can see

1664
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,960
if I just turn off the satellite

1665
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,980
that’s it, it’s a bit rough and ready

1666
01:05:41,333 --> 01:05:44,243
double-click it and then we’ll turn

1667
01:05:44,266 --> 01:05:46,606
that into a polyline and then we

1668
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,940
can see how big it is, so

1669
01:05:48,966 --> 01:05:50,886
`Draw Polyline From Selection`

1670
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,779
and that gives me an area of

1671
01:05:54,766 --> 01:05:57,706
102 metres, so that’s

1672
01:05:57,733 --> 01:05:59,173
how big their garden is

1673
01:05:59,166 --> 01:06:00,516
so it’s a bit under the

1674
01:06:00,766 --> 01:06:03,766
average, the average for a UK London garden

1675
01:06:03,766 --> 01:06:06,706
is a 140 square metres

1676
01:06:06,766 --> 01:06:08,506
and theirs comes in at just over

1677
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:12,100
100 square metres okay

1678
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,410
so then what I would do is

1679
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,780
to put the path in

1680
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:20,540
in areas and this is where sometimes

1681
01:06:20,566 --> 01:06:21,616
you want to change the colours of

1682
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:22,950
your layers so you can actually see

1683
01:06:22,966 --> 01:06:23,956
what's going on, as you can see

1684
01:06:23,933 --> 01:06:25,313
from this you can hardly,

1685
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:27,043
you can't actually see the red

1686
01:06:27,466 --> 01:06:29,296
on that boundary on this particular image

1687
01:06:29,433 --> 01:06:31,263
so this is where you would play

1688
01:06:31,266 --> 01:06:33,186
around with the different colours, so we’ll get

1689
01:06:33,166 --> 01:06:35,416
the, ah the kitchen door is around

1690
01:06:35,433 --> 01:06:36,273
about here somewhere

1691
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:38,899
and say oh we want a new

1692
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:40,700
path and that path goes up to

1693
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:40,999
here

1694
01:06:42,066 --> 01:06:42,846
up to the shed

1695
01:06:44,966 --> 01:06:45,536
okay

1696
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,209
let’s just turn off that satellite

1697
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,130
so you can see what's going on

1698
01:06:50,133 --> 01:06:51,153
so that’s my path

1699
01:06:53,433 --> 01:06:54,753
I’ll make it into a polyline so it’s

1700
01:06:54,733 --> 01:06:58,033
easier to use so `Draw > Polyline

1701
01:06:58,033 --> 01:07:00,853
Polyline From Selection` and that sets it as

1702
01:07:00,866 --> 01:07:01,303
a group

1703
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,140
and then

1704
01:07:06,133 --> 01:07:07,453
oh let’s go and put the the

1705
01:07:07,433 --> 01:07:08,963
shed in, there’s a shed down here

1706
01:07:08,966 --> 01:07:11,726
in the bottom left-hand corner so

1707
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:14,810
I’ll go into my shape tools

1708
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,610
and I’ll just draw it freehand

1709
01:07:19,333 --> 01:07:23,023
so `Snap Free` so it

1710
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,700
doesn't snap onto anything else

1711
01:07:26,966 --> 01:07:30,618
I’ll do that there, there we go I’ve

1712
01:07:30,633 --> 01:07:32,613
gone and drawn it into the

1713
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:36,859
areas layer, so how you move

1714
01:07:36,866 --> 01:07:39,026
it in the `Property Editor` is to

1715
01:07:39,033 --> 01:07:40,713
select the thing that you want

1716
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:43,399
to move and then change the

1717
01:07:44,533 --> 01:07:45,823
the layer that it’s in. I

1718
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:47,093
want to put it into the Structures

1719
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,570
layer and there you will see, it will

1720
01:07:48,566 --> 01:07:50,806
automatically change colour down here, we just

1721
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:52,213
turn off the satellite so you can

1722
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:55,320
see, okay? Double-click it, I’ll turn it

1723
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:58,033
into a block actually `Create Block

1724
01:07:58,033 --> 01:07:58,723
From Selection`

1725
01:08:01,066 --> 01:08:03,376
Okay and I’m going to call that shed and

1726
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:04,090
then you’ll see

1727
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,680
the shed will appear here in the

1728
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:12,316
`Block List`, okay?

1729
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,960
And then it’s the same principle now

1730
01:08:17,966 --> 01:08:20,396
as well for putting in trees and

1731
01:08:20,433 --> 01:08:23,103
shrubs I’ve got my forest

1732
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,990
garden plants blocks here, I’ll put up

1733
01:08:25,066 --> 01:08:28,996
a hazel down here, Corylus avellana so

1734
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,710
the big name’s the common name

1735
01:08:31,033 --> 01:08:33,612
and then the botanical name’s underneath

1736
01:08:34,266 --> 01:08:35,795
and the botanical names is

1737
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,121
in the list, in the `Layer List`

1738
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:38,321
so let’s cut that

1739
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,330
go over to the garden town go

1740
01:08:42,333 --> 01:08:43,292
to shrub

1741
01:08:45,366 --> 01:08:47,736
paste it in there, wow, much much

1742
01:08:47,733 --> 01:08:50,773
bigger it’s a town garden so the

1743
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:54,110
trees obviously much larger size, so there

1744
01:08:54,133 --> 01:08:55,093
we go and then you can do

1745
01:08:55,066 --> 01:08:57,886
that with individual beds with the paths

1746
01:08:58,033 --> 01:09:00,673
putting plants in, putting different features in

1747
01:09:01,666 --> 01:09:04,575
greenhouses, patios, all that kind

1748
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,161
of stuff, then you start to build

1749
01:09:06,133 --> 01:09:08,022
up the design for the garden but

1750
01:09:08,033 --> 01:09:10,194
as I said before, the most important

1751
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,719
thing when you're creating these designs is

1752
01:09:12,733 --> 01:09:15,432
to get the spacing right between the

1753
01:09:15,866 --> 01:09:17,816
trees, make sure that they've

1754
01:09:17,833 --> 01:09:19,392
got the paths in the right

1755
01:09:19,366 --> 01:09:21,887
place, so getting the structure in the

1756
01:09:21,966 --> 01:09:24,577
The smaller planting is much much easier

1757
01:09:24,566 --> 01:09:24,745
to do

1758
01:09:24,733 --> 01:09:26,474
on-site so you don’t have

1759
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,210
to be so precise about

1760
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,299
the designs for them but

1761
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,249
it’s really really important to get the

1762
01:09:32,233 --> 01:09:34,273
trees and the paths and the main

1763
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:37,091
structures in place first. And that brings us

1764
01:09:37,066 --> 01:09:39,642
to a close and what I also have

1765
01:09:40,633 --> 01:09:44,112
a whole load of resources, so there’s the

1766
01:09:44,133 --> 01:09:44,914
link for downloading

1767
01:09:44,899 --> 01:09:46,908
QCAD, they've got the CAD files

1768
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:50,473
for this class, I’ve also created

1769
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:53,666
a public Telegram group called Garden Wild Edible

1770
01:09:53,666 --> 01:09:55,566
which goes along with these classes

1771
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,300
and that’s a space if you want

1772
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:00,210
to ask any questions, then feel free

1773
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,833
to join and then ask questions

1774
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:03,700
if you’ve got any questions about QCAD

1775
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,059
kind of technical

1776
01:10:05,066 --> 01:10:06,746
stuff then there’s a QCAD

1777
01:10:06,733 --> 01:10:09,313
link to QCAD forum, there’s my template

1778
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:12,783
my delicious CAD template file

1779
01:10:12,766 --> 01:10:15,166
native plants spreadsheet which I haven't shown

1780
01:10:15,166 --> 01:10:16,336
you which I ought to show you

1781
01:10:16,633 --> 01:10:20,503
and the forest garden spreadsheet

1782
01:10:20,533 --> 01:10:22,753
I will be using these more

1783
01:10:22,733 --> 01:10:25,190
in the design section of

1784
01:10:25,233 --> 01:10:27,933
the classes. So the Garden Wild Spreadsheet

1785
01:10:27,966 --> 01:10:30,246
is a list of native plants, it’s

1786
01:10:30,233 --> 01:10:31,853
flowers just at the moment, I’ve got

1787
01:10:31,933 --> 01:10:36,043
space for other native forms but the

1788
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,900
Forest Garden Spreadsheet is a list of

1789
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,549
all the forest garden plants in

1790
01:10:39,533 --> 01:10:41,362
Martin Crawford's book as well so loads and

1791
01:10:41,366 --> 01:10:43,886
loads of information there and then you’ve

1792
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,400
got my CAD blocks too

1793
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,049
That draws us to an end

1794
01:10:47,033 --> 01:10:49,253
I hope that’s useful, if you do want

1795
01:10:49,266 --> 01:10:50,556
to get in touch with me, my

1796
01:10:50,533 --> 01:10:52,483
email address is here

1797
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:53,910
hello@natureworks.org.uk and you

1798
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:55,339
can sign up for my newsletter as

1799
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:57,252
well. Thank you very much, see you

1800
01:10:57,266 --> 01:10:58,257
again soon, cheers, bye!
