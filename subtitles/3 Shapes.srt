00:00:00,266 --> 00:00:02,456
Greetings and welcome back to the third

2
00:00:02,466 --> 00:00:04,956
section of my online class ‘CAD for

3
00:00:04,933 --> 00:00:07,723
Gardeners’ and this is shapes, entities and

4
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:09,893
mods, you can just about see

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,939
the mods, my face is nearly covering

6
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:14,183
it, and here I’m going to be

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,340
looking at four basic shapes, three entity

8
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,163
types and then four modifications

9
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:22,176
that you can make. And using

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,380
these tools, you can create a whole

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,989
infinite variety of different designs, hopefully. First

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,890
of all, before going further, I wanted

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,749
to say about finding your way

14
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:36,533
around QCAD because it can be a

15
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:37,973
little bit confusing. So I’m just going

16
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:39,976
to zip over to QCAD

17
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:43,616
I’ll create a new file, I’m

18
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:45,013
just going to create a circle and

19
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,026
really worry too much about what I’m

20
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:47,543
doing here…

21
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:51,263
The great thing as I said before

22
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:53,006
about QCAD is that you can

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,130
zoom in and you can zoom out

24
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,883
and it can be two hundred miles

25
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,939
wide or it can be twenty centimetres

26
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:02,873
wide. The QCAD doesn’t really matter

27
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:04,456
it’s kind of 1:1 scale

28
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:06,386
and you work at whatever size

29
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:07,723
the thing is that you’re working on

30
00:01:08,566 --> 00:01:08,866
Erm…

31
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:12,016
so for zooming in, zooming out, there’s

32
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:14,013
the mouse scroll. Sorry, that’s a really

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,950
really bad pun. That is a mouse

34
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,840
with a scroll, took ages to

35
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:20,443
find that one. Mouse scroll will zoom

36
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:21,786
you in and out so the mouse

37
00:01:21,766 --> 00:01:24,046
scroll is that button there and that

38
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:26,846
will zoom you in and out in CAD. The plus

39
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,423
or minus keys on your keyboard

40
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:31,746
Snd then if you get lost, it’s

41
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,849
`View > Zoom > Auto Zoom` and that will

42
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:37,323
get you back to where

43
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,953
your drawing is. I’ll just show you what

44
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:40,376
I mean. So mouse scroll first of

45
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,646
all, so mouse scroll, zoom in and

46
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:43,986
you can zoom in, zoom in and

47
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:46,276
zoom in and zoom in and and

48
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,579
it’s just incredible how much you

49
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,196
can zoom in

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,810
until your screen is filled with

51
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,260
a line. Then you can zoom out

52
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:55,766
as well and you can zoom out

53
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,846
and the problem with this zooming

54
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,393
in, zooming out, plus minus keys

55
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:04,436
minus, plus… oopsie, the problem

56
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:06,053
is, it’s actually really really easy to

57
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:08,166
get lost and I’ve got no idea

58
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:10,826
where my circle’s gone. So if you

59
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:15,126
go to `View` menu and then `Zoom`

60
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:19,173
and zoom auto, `Auto Zoom` which has

61
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:20,586
`ZA` as the

62
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:23,043
keyboard shortcut. It’s kinda nice to use

63
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:24,863
keyboard shortcuts because it speeds things up

64
00:02:24,866 --> 00:02:26,996
but don’t worry about it. So click

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,210
on `Auto Zoom`, wmf, it brings your

66
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,390
drawing into full view. So if you’re

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,020
zooming in and zooming out, you don’t

68
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:37,243
know where you are, click `View > Zoom >

69
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:39,663
Auto Zoom` and it brings you straight

70
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:40,806
back. I’ll just do it again, `View >

71
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,829
Zoom > Auto Zoom` it brings you

72
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:48,303
straight back. Okay? The next

73
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,909
thing is panning, so with panning

74
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,869
that means kind of scrubbing or

75
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,330
moving across the screen

76
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,586
So that’s a mouse scroll click, so

77
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:01,303
again the mouse scroll button and then click

78
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,983
it down and then you

79
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:05,486
can pan around the document

80
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:09,676
or `View > Zoom > Pan Zoom`, so holding

81
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,050
down the mouse scroll you know

82
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:12,233
you can

83
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:15,846
pan across like that or `View > Zoom >

84
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:18,256
Pan Zoom` and that enables you to

85
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:20,573
scroll down and get really really dizzy

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,839
So the next bit that I wanted

87
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,323
to show you was what what happens

88
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,610
if you kind of get lost at all

89
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:31,603
The thing to remember, is don’t

90
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,139
panic

91
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:34,893
So there’s two ways that I can

92
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,699
get lost. Firstly, as I said before

93
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:40,953
is zooming and zooming out, so

94
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:43,753
that’s `View > Zoom > Auto Zoom`, so if

95
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:45,026
I don’t know where I am and

96
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,310
I can’t see anything, `ZA`, bof!

97
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:50,346
Brings it straight back. The other thing

98
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,493
is, if I’ve started clicking on different

99
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,396
tools and I don’t know how to

100
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,650
get back to the pointer, just hit

101
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:58,613
the escape key and that returns you

102
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:01,153
to the arrow tool. So, just keep

103
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,906
hitting it and eventually you’ll get back

104
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,310
to the pointer tool and

105
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,463
then get back to square one, okay

106
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:08,923
So those two tools are really really useful

107
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,746
to get back to

108
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,170
your drawing and also to get back

109
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:12,706
to your arrow

110
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:15,815
Right, so next up is shapes

111
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,773
entities and mods. As I said, four

112
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:21,646
shapes, three entities and four mods. What

113
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,136
you want to do, press the `P`

114
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:25,953
key again, you want to download the files

115
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,606
from here. This is the CAD

116
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:31,393
gardener’s files and I’ll just show you

117
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:32,806
where you get them from

118
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:34,816
So this is where the files are

119
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,713
stored and the files are in a

120
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,160
folder called `cad-shapes-entities-mods`, probably

121
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,606
the easiest thing to do is download them

122
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,130
altogether, so if you click on the

123
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,046
`Code` button and then `Download zip`, unzip

124
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:47,203
it and then you’ve got the CAD

125
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:48,613
files that you can play around with

126
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,986
First thing then that we’re going to

127
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:50,296
do

128
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:53,533
is to look at creating the four

129
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:56,113
shapes. So you’ve got a rectangle, line

130
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,716
tool, circles for trees and NURBS for

131
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,870
curves. How terribly exciting. So rectangle is under

132
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:04,966
the `Shape Tools` in the

133
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:07,426
toolbar menu and the two rectangles that I

134
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:09,563
use all the time, there’s like one

135
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:11,516
which is just drawing a rectangle, so

136
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,499
yeah, I know that it

137
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,949
will be drawn like that

138
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,169
Hit escape key, back for the pointer and

139
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,696
it draws a rectangle

140
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:20,816
made out of lines

141
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,616
And the other one that I use

142
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:28,206
probably a lot more, is the rectangle

143
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:30,033
with size and this is actually really

144
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:32,463
useful. So say I’ve got a, oh I don’t

145
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:35,436
know, I’ve got a shed that’s

146
00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:37,833
3 metres by 2 metres

147
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:41,236
I kind of just put the size

148
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:42,553
in, along the top here

149
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,680
and then there we go, it’s

150
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:48,041
a shed which is fantastic. So

151
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:50,435
that’s a rectangle tool. We use rectangles

152
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,503
mostly for structures in a garden, so

153
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:55,053
sheds, some polytunnels and steps and

154
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:58,363
stuff like that. The next tool is

155
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,010
the line tool. So hit `Escape` to go

156
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:03,523
back to the arrow tool

157
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:06,073
click on `Line Tools` and I only ever

158
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,406
use one line tool and that is

159
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,290
this one here, which is `Line from

160
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,790
2 Points`. And I just go… pom-ti-dom…

161
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:15,766
create a line like

162
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:18,406
that. And a line tools good for kind

163
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:22,981
of irregular non-rectilinear shapes and it’s also

164
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,990
really really good for

165
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,050
for creating

166
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,263
paths, for example, so you don’t have

167
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:30,646
to use NURBS, you don’t have to

168
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,226
create curvy paths, if you

169
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,396
want to just for quickness

170
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,860
you can create a basic path like

171
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:39,776
that, yeah, so that’s the kind of

172
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:40,846
thing that you can use it for

173
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:42,876
as well. And then creating boundaries. I’ll

174
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:44,036
be going through all these when I

175
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:45,533
do the examples as well, to give

176
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:46,253
you some real world

177
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,693
examples. The third shape is

178
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,982
a circle and again, the circle tool, and

179
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,627
I only ever create, it’s all

180
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:57,613
these different options, it’s mind blowing

181
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,520
how many different options there are and what

182
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:01,513
you can do with them and tangents

183
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,906
and all sorts of stuff, but I

184
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,524
only ever use one circle and that’s

185
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:06,483
circles for trees, so you click

186
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:06,736
there

187
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,573
we go, and that tool is called

188
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:13,603
let’s just make sure I’ve got the right name, `Center

189
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,493
Point`, so you draw a circle from the

190
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,020
point and there we go and you

191
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:20,343
can just draw circles for trees. And this

192
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,373
is where the `Property` widget comes in

193
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,560
really really handy because what you can

194
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:27,656
do, select the shape and then say

195
00:07:27,966 --> 00:07:28,086
oh

196
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:30,316
I don’t know, there’s a Sweet Chestnut

197
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:34,146
is roughly 15 metres diameter, if you

198
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:37,133
look in the `Property Editor` under diameter

199
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,810
down here on the right hand side

200
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,749
and then type in 15, there you

201
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:45,553
go, that’s the diameter of a Sweet

202
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,840
Chestnut. And then I can say ‘Oh

203
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:49,244
right then, I want to create another

204
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:51,363
one’. And this is going to be

205
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:53,736
4 metres wide because that’s the diameter

206
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:57,443
Select, draw the circle, select it, diameter

207
00:07:57,566 --> 00:07:58,256
4

208
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,600
And that’s the diameter of an apple

209
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,519
tree on an MM106

210
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,890
rootstock, for example. So now you’ve got

211
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,770
circles for trees, and then you can

212
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:10,896
work out, using the tree spacing, you

213
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,439
can calculate the distance actually it

214
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:15,903
should be between the trees. And

215
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,479
finally, NURBS. I wasn't going to show

216
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:20,266
show you NURBS but they’re so great

217
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,556
that’s such a brilliant name, it

218
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:24,926
stands for Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines

219
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:26,976
I think. Have a play and

220
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:28,046
if you like them and get on

221
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:29,863
with them, then use them. Again, I only

222
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:31,636
ever use one spline tool, this one

223
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:33,973
at the top, spline with control points

224
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:40,376
And you can click, click, click, double-

225
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:43,246
click to stop the drawing, escape

226
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,773
to get the arrow tool back and

227
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:47,586
then you’ve got a control point, which

228
00:08:47,566 --> 00:08:50,506
is here, which is fantastic

229
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,733
There we go and then obviously

230
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:57,375
you can create a lot more complex shapes

231
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,007
so if you’re creating a path, it’s a

232
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:03,513
wibbly wobbly path, you can do

233
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,500
all sorts of great, great, great fun

234
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,160
stuff

235
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:10,153
This is a really good moment to

236
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,876
talk about the snap tool because this

237
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:13,336
makes your life an awful lot easier

238
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:15,726
So what it’s set to by default

239
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:18,283
when you create a shape, let’s go

240
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,893
back and get a line tool because it’ll

241
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,140
be probably easier, it’s snapping to the

242
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:23,703
grid

243
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,249
or it’s snapping on an intersection

244
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,980
and that’s the default behavior. So it

245
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:34,856
kind of guesses where you want

246
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,996
to snap to which is great but

247
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,920
sometimes you say ‘I want it just

248
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,240
over here’ and it’s not enough

249
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:42,075
you want to make a free play

250
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:44,623
sort of thing for your snapping and

251
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,709
the way to do that is to

252
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:48,043
use `Snap Free`. So if you go

253
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:48,483
to the `Snap`

254
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:51,706
menu and then go `Snap Free`

255
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:54,853
or `SF` is a shortcut, then

256
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:56,543
it’s not snapping to anything

257
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:57,946
at all. So it means it won’t

258
00:09:57,966 --> 00:09:59,406
snap onto a line. So it depends

259
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,390
what you’re trying

260
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,900
to achieve. I don’t know, like if you’ve

261
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,640
got a curvy curvy path that

262
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:05,343
you want to make then you

263
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,833
don’t really want to have it snapping

264
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,633
directly to a grid or directly to another object

265
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:10,586
Sometimes you do want it to snap

266
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,680
so for example if I wanted to

267
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,406
close this shape, I want it to snap

268
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:14,843
on the corner but it’s not going

269
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,663
to, it’s just going to do it a

270
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,126
little bit away. So `Snap Free`

271
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:20,993
really very useful for freehand stuff

272
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,293
And then the other one that you

273
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:23,629
want

274
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,713
quite commonly is `Snap On Entity`, which

275
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:30,253
is `ST`, so get a line tool

276
00:10:30,266 --> 00:10:31,856
and I say okay, I know that

277
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:35,016
I want to snap onto the rectangle

278
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:37,316
somewhere, see, it’s auto-snapping

279
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,833
here, you can see it’s auto-snapping

280
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,723
to the middle and auto-snapping to

281
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:42,653
the intersection but I want it to

282
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:44,913
snap on the actual entity

283
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,989
itself, like on this circle

284
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,060
for example. If I go `Snap On

285
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:50,906
Entity`

286
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:53,843
then it will glue itself to that

287
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:56,656
entity. And I want to

288
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,724
take it off, I can go `Snap Auto`

289
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,836
`Snap Auto` down here, and then it’s

290
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,693
going back to automatically snapping

291
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:06,903
to the grid or to the end

292
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,539
of something else. So that’s a

293
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:11,244
really really handy one. The final

294
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:14,566
snap is `Snap to End`, so this is

295
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,009
great if you’ve got a shape and

296
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,260
you say I want to

297
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:18,496
close this shape here

298
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,483
so it’s like a closed

299
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:21,920
shape

300
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,619
So what you do there, get the

301
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,939
line tool and

302
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,856
you can click, snap, and just to

303
00:11:29,866 --> 00:11:31,340
make sure it snaps on end you

304
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,898
go `Snap on End`, bomf! It

305
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,944
won’t snap anywhere else and you’re guaranteed

306
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:39,303
that that shape is enclosed now. So

307
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:44,893
these snapping facilities are really really useful

308
00:11:44,933 --> 00:11:46,133
it’s really handy to know

309
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:48,113
them. And it’s, yeah, just be aware

310
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,361
that you’ve got the snap menu

311
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:51,378
there and then you can use the

312
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:54,216
snapping tools as and when you see

313
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:55,553
fit. So when it comes up, you

314
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:57,123
go ‘Why won’t this

315
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,906
line go here?’ and you can figure out

316
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,249
whether it needs to be `Snap Auto`

317
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:02,363
or `Snap Free` or `Snap Entity` or

318
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:03,656
`Snap to the End`

319
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:08,603
Okay, let’s get onto the entities. We’ve

320
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:12,443
got three entities, that’s block, polyline and

321
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,626
text, and they're all pretty

322
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,543
cool in their own special ways. A

323
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:20,773
block is really really useful if you’re

324
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,520
creating a symbol. It can be re-used

325
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:24,856
over and over again. So for example

326
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,653
you have an orchard and it’s

327
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,256
got a lot of the same apple

328
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:29,556
trees in it. You can just make

329
00:12:29,566 --> 00:12:32,386
one apple tree and then plant lots

330
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:34,616
of different instances around. When you edit

331
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:36,823
the one block, it changes all those

332
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:40,313
instances. But it’s also useful for creating

333
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,069
a shape and then applying any angle

334
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:44,333
So in this example I’ve created a

335
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:44,933
bench

336
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:46,483
and I’ve then created an angle

337
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:47,396
on it. I’ll show you how to

338
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,959
do that. So hit escape to go

339
00:12:48,966 --> 00:12:52,116
back to the arrow tool, go click

340
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:55,133
onto the shape tools and I’ll

341
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:58,313
just create any old rectangle

342
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,310
And rather than, what you can

343
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,163
do, if you go into the shape

344
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,832
tools and then shape with

345
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,173
sizes, you can put an angle in

346
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:12,196
here but then it’s much harder once

347
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,090
you’ve created that angle. Once you’ve created

348
00:13:14,066 --> 00:13:16,106
that shape, it’s much much harder to

349
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:18,773
edit it. So you’re better off creating

350
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,542
it so that it’s

351
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:23,736
square and *then* applying the angle afterwards

352
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,820
So I’ll just show you how to

353
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,389
create a block, so you select all

354
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:27,790
those

355
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:31,576
elements, go to the `Block` menu and

356
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:36,006
then `Create Block From Selection` and then

357
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,140
you say where you want to create

358
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,813
it from, sets the corner, and I’m

359
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,083
going to call it, I don’t know, shed

360
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,190
And down here in the `Block List`

361
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,430
on the right hand side you can see

362
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:46,663
shed comes up and then I can

363
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,096
have multiple sheds

364
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,630
and I can put sheds down all

365
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:53,903
over the place. Hooray. So now, for

366
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,186
example, I want to edit it, I’m

367
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,990
gonna say I want to

368
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,730
I don’t know, colour the lines

369
00:14:00,766 --> 00:14:02,776
make the lines a different colour, I’ll

370
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:04,236
make them green

371
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:08,486
And then go out, and so now I’ve

372
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,509
got green sheds all over the place

373
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:13,226
But if I just want to rotate

374
00:14:13,233 --> 00:14:15,453
one of my sheds, I can go

375
00:14:15,466 --> 00:14:17,986
here and I’ll just give it an

376
00:14:17,966 --> 00:14:21,656
angle in the `Properties`, it’s 45 degrees

377
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:24,362
type in 45 degrees and just

378
00:14:24,366 --> 00:14:25,567
that instance has

379
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:27,156
changed so that’s really kind of, yeah

380
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,243
it’s really really handy and then you

381
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:30,312
can make sure that you get the

382
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,819
right angle and it’s much much easier

383
00:14:33,466 --> 00:14:35,236
to control. Cool

384
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:39,834
The other entity that I want to

385
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,683
talk about was the polyline and these

386
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,436
are great. Best way to show you

387
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:46,532
this is with the line tool so

388
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,850
go for the line tool

389
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,420
and I’ll create kind of

390
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,040
linage thing, wibbly wobbly line, eeeh!

391
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:56,863
And that’s great and you go well that’s

392
00:14:56,866 --> 00:14:57,795
fantastic

393
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:00,517
but the pain in the bum is

394
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:01,973
that I have to create a shift

395
00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:04,486
click every single item before I want

396
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:06,026
to move it or have to select

397
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:08,103
them all by dragging it like that

398
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,749
and that can be a bit painful

399
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:11,296
So it’s much better

400
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:13,746
or you can double-click and it

401
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:15,263
will select the whole shape, but unless

402
00:15:15,266 --> 00:15:17,246
the shape then is touching

403
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:18,646
something else it’ll select all that as

404
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:21,663
well, so much much better to create

405
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,669
a polyline of that line. So

406
00:15:24,766 --> 00:15:26,930
create a polyline, dom-dom, double-click to

407
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:28,913
select all of them and you go

408
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:31,723
`Draw > Polyline >

409
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:36,166
Polyline From Selection` and I am constantly

410
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,446
amazed at the number of different options

411
00:15:38,433 --> 00:15:40,683
that we’ve got but just concentrate, all

412
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,830
you have to do is concentrate on

413
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,243
the ones I’m giving you and

414
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:45,643
that to be honest these are all

415
00:15:45,633 --> 00:15:47,493
the only ones I ever use myself

416
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:52,643
So `Polyline From Selection`, there we go

417
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,413
now, wow, look, it treats it as a

418
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:56,453
whole kind of group

419
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,600
And what it also does, if you

420
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,310
click on it, it will give you

421
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,493
an area, so try and work out

422
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,790
what that area is

423
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,903
Another handy tool, if you’ve got a

424
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,749
polyline, then you want to explode it. This

425
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,023
really ought to be in modifications but

426
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,489
there’s a bomb here, set off that

427
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,970
stick of dynamite, boff! it explodes it and

428
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,563
what I want to do now is

429
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:25,296
to close that line, so hit

430
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,038
escape key

431
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:27,745
to go back to the arrow tool

432
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:29,356
click on the line tool and I’m

433
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,883
going to close that shape and now

434
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:35,193
you can imagine, double-click, create a

435
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,139
polyline from that and you can say

436
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:41,703
yep, that is now a garden bed

437
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,430
and I know that by clicking on

438
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:45,413
it, this is about the garden bed

439
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,030
is

440
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,479
about 5 metres diameter [square!] and with a

441
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,106
planting density of 5 plants per square

442
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:54,893
metre, that’s 25 plants, thank you

443
00:16:54,866 --> 00:16:56,156
very much. So this is where it

444
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,926
comes in really really useful using these

445
00:16:58,933 --> 00:17:02,503
different tools. And then finally the last

446
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,446
entity that I wanted to discuss is

447
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:06,343
text tool

448
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,990
And it kinda does what it says

449
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,829
on the tin really, enables you to

450
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,933
put labels on things which is handy

451
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:12,743
if you want to know what the

452
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:14,293
trees are that you’re using

453
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,053
or what a particular structure is so

454
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:17,833
double-click

455
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,060
and then escape to go back to

456
00:17:21,066 --> 00:17:23,737
the tool menu and arrow tool and

457
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,142
I’m going to click on the text

458
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:27,833
tool. Click on `Text` and it brings up

459
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,650
the whole lot here. For some reason

460
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:32,426
I always colour my text orange I

461
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:33,723
think it’s a middle

462
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:35,323
of the road colour and fits in

463
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,603
with everything else. I’m going to call this shed

464
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:42,483
I’m gonna make it orange and think

465
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,460
it needs to be a bit smaller, there we go and

466
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:47,813
you’ve got lots of options. If you

467
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,393
double-click on the text on

468
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,720
the text itself it brings up the

469
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,740
text dialog box and you’ve got lots

470
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:54,922
of options for whether it aligns in

471
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:56,644
the center or in the middle so that’s

472
00:17:56,633 --> 00:17:59,003
all kind of handy too. There we go

473
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:03,676
so shed, pop that there, escape from

474
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,556
the block so I’m editing the block

475
00:18:05,566 --> 00:18:07,006
at the moment in the `Block List`

476
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:09,473
click on that and then you can see

477
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,779
it’s got shed at an angle, there we

478
00:18:11,766 --> 00:18:15,006
go. So those are your three entities

479
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,846
What I wanted to show you

480
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,353
next is very quickly is layers. Layers

481
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,780
is a really really good way of

482
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,410
organising different information. So you have

483
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:26,533
one layer for areas, one layer for

484
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:29,053
structures, another layer for plants or trees

485
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,840
you get the idea so you can

486
00:18:30,866 --> 00:18:33,008
organize it by different layers and

487
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,188
then you can give different colors to

488
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,760
each layer as well, which again helps

489
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,753
with organising all the different elements

490
00:18:38,966 --> 00:18:41,696
There is on my GitHub website, you

491
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,559
can download a template so you can

492
00:18:43,566 --> 00:18:45,306
just click down here and download the

493
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,930
zip and then open up that file

494
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:51,693
and it will give

495
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,800
you this which is a list

496
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,540
of all the layers and it’s also

497
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:57,603
got a handy little legend which I’ve premade

498
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,980
here as well, as a block

499
00:18:59,933 --> 00:19:01,913
And I’ll be using this when I’m

500
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:05,233
going through the different examples too

501
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:10,573
And then finally we’ve got the mods, four

502
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,659
different modifications to make. I’ll just go

503
00:19:13,633 --> 00:19:14,383
through them with you

504
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:17,816
So here we go, mods you’ve got

505
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,203
four different types. Now this example is

506
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,100
actually taken from a real world example

507
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:27,463
of a gabion. Gabions are those wire

508
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,263
cages with stones in. And it’s a

509
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,963
gabion horseshoe shape that I’m creating for the

510
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:35,433
local primary school. It’s like a seating

511
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:35,733
area

512
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,540
but a kind of sheltered seating area

513
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:40,033
So I’ll just go through how

514
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:41,113
I’ve created it

515
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:46,706
On the center point

516
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:50,703
I create a circle as the first thing

517
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,463
and the modification tools are under this

518
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:57,336
menu over here. Ahhh, modification tools you’ve

519
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:00,543
already seen the the dynamite stick, so

520
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,153
select the element

521
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:03,913
that you want to modify

522
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:06,483
and I’m going to use offset

523
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,909
I think which is this one

524
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:10,393
here `Offset (with Distance)`

525
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:13,636
Okay it’s just 0.5 metres

526
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:14,773
that’s how wide it is, I might make

527
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,285
a little bit narrower

528
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:19,126
0.4, 0.3 metres

529
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:19,493
say

530
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:22,886
there we go, you get the idea

531
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,259
Yeah, 0.3 metres, 30 centimetres

532
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,970
and there we go that’s an offset

533
00:20:30,966 --> 00:20:32,946
and you can offset it either way

534
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,350
Okay? Now I’ll take that shape and I

535
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,123
want to put two lines on to

536
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,846
cut into it, so I’m going to

537
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,876
draw one line on one side and a

538
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,710
mirror onto the other side and

539
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,329
let’s do that

540
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:51,505
Hit escape to go back, line tool, draw

541
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,659
from the centre, draw out here

542
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,290
Hit escape again, go back, select it with

543
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,879
the arrow tool, go to the modification

544
00:20:59,866 --> 00:21:04,216
tools and up here is the mirror

545
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,302
and then click on mirror and say you

546
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:10,211
want to here, that line there. And

547
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,939
I want to keep the original and

548
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:13,403
I want to just flip it over. Bomf

549
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,135
There we go, so that’s the mirror tool

550
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:18,243
so that’s really good if you’ve got

551
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:21,143
any kind of symmetrical shapes that you

552
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:23,053
want to create and you can

553
00:21:23,066 --> 00:21:25,346
mirror them. And now we go onto the

554
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,033
divide tool, this is always a great

555
00:21:28,033 --> 00:21:29,143
deal of fun so you can see

556
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,396
what I’m trying to achieve here at

557
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,880
the end is to cut where

558
00:21:33,866 --> 00:21:35,036
those lines intersect

559
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:38,423
So go back, hit escape key

560
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,033
to go back to the arrow tool

561
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,893
modification tools and then it’s the scissor

562
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,850
tool, which is great, nice

563
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:48,973
and easy and for the inner circle

564
00:21:49,033 --> 00:21:51,343
click on the divide tool, the red pair of scissors

565
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:55,206
click on the inner circle, intersection

566
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,479
and intersection

567
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:01,623
select that segment, click delete, there you

568
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:04,363
go. And a really handy hint

569
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,379
if you are doing any drawing at all

570
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,880
with the line tool, rather than have

571
00:22:08,866 --> 00:22:11,446
to redraw the line, using the snap

572
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:13,963
the automatic snap, you select the end

573
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,643
of the line and it will snap automatically

574
00:22:15,866 --> 00:22:18,605
to the intersection with that circle. So

575
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:21,343
that’s very often the kind of quickest

576
00:22:21,366 --> 00:22:24,696
way of creating the shape is to

577
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,250
use your existing lines and let the

578
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:29,153
snap do the work for you, like

579
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,506
that and there we go, we’ve got horseshoe

580
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,139
shape. I’ll turn that to make life

581
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:36,353
easier I’m going to turn this into a

582
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,320
block and I’ll

583
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,580
select all the items, all the elements

584
00:22:41,566 --> 00:22:45,496
in there, `Block > Create Block From Selection`

585
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:47,416
click in the centre

586
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,970
and I’m going to call that, oh

587
00:22:49,966 --> 00:22:51,586
I don’t know, horsehoe or something

588
00:22:52,933 --> 00:22:54,062
And there we go, we’ve got a block

589
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,601
and just makes that easier, creating a

590
00:22:56,633 --> 00:22:58,313
block makes it easy to rotate so that

591
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,733
you can fine tune it. So select

592
00:23:00,733 --> 00:23:03,763
that, go to the `Property Editor` and

593
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:05,293
I want to give it an angle of

594
00:23:05,366 --> 00:23:07,856
I don’t know, 45 degrees or

595
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,760
56 degrees why not 56

596
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:11,773
degrees and there we go it’s an

597
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,970
angle of 56 degrees

598
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,989
for the horseshoe shape. So there we

599
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,280
go that’s how we're using these four

600
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:20,986
different modifications to create a horseshoe shape

601
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,099
gabion wall seating area

602
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,467
And finally I just want to talk to you about

603
00:23:25,466 --> 00:23:28,346
the blocks that we have our disposal

604
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,966
there’s three different types of blocks that

605
00:23:30,966 --> 00:23:33,126
I’ve got, there’s forest garden plants

606
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,060
again you can download these zip files

607
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,200
native wild plants, this is only has

608
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,370
a couple of plants in at the moment

609
00:23:39,366 --> 00:23:40,626
and this project I’m gonna be working

610
00:23:40,633 --> 00:23:42,283
on, and then garden furniture which has

611
00:23:42,266 --> 00:23:44,276
got some useful garden furniture in it

612
00:23:44,266 --> 00:23:46,006
like benches and steps and stuff like

613
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:48,253
that and people. So I’ll just show

614
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:50,633
you forest garden plants first of all

615
00:23:53,366 --> 00:23:54,776
So if I click on open

616
00:23:56,933 --> 00:23:59,693
blocks, forest garden and then that’s divided

617
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,740
into five different sections and the forest

618
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:05,963
garden plants blocks, it’s incomplete but there’s

619
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:07,976
a spreadsheet that I have created, I’ll

620
00:24:07,966 --> 00:24:10,036
just show you the page first of all

621
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:13,613
there’s a spreadsheet I’ve created forest garden

622
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:18,433
bit.ly/forest-garden-spreadsheet and

623
00:24:18,433 --> 00:24:19,753
this has a list of all the

624
00:24:19,766 --> 00:24:22,466
plants in this book and I’ve started

625
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,810
to put all the plants into a

626
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,773
block list so I was doing it anyway

627
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,716
for myself but you're more than welcome

628
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:30,963
to dip in and help them

629
00:24:30,966 --> 00:24:31,445
out, help

630
00:24:31,566 --> 00:24:32,826
yourself to any of the

631
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:34,303
trees which are in there so I

632
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,360
don’t know there’s a Crataegus

633
00:24:37,466 --> 00:24:41,278
dilatata, whatever that is, click

634
00:24:41,266 --> 00:24:43,574
it out here so to

635
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,100
get a block out I’ll just show you that

636
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,911
again, select it from the list

637
00:24:48,033 --> 00:24:49,803
the block that you want and

638
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,599
then click on that icon here which

639
00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:54,513
is `Insert Block` and it gives you it out

640
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,310
here. And there you go, Broadleaf Hawthorn, so

641
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:01,123
I’ll copy that, go back to my

642
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,819
mods

643
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:05,363
paste it in, there we have a

644
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,484
Broadleaf Hawthorn and there’s, you’ve

645
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,766
got quite a choice of quite a

646
00:25:09,733 --> 00:25:12,823
few plants there. And

647
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:17,693
then finally for garden furniture, blocks, furniture

648
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:20,433
again you can download this. This has

649
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:22,773
got useful things like I don’t know

650
00:25:23,066 --> 00:25:26,546
a deck chair so you can copy

651
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,706
and then just copy and paste it

652
00:25:27,733 --> 00:25:29,383
in and then we’ve got a Broadleaf

653
00:25:29,433 --> 00:25:31,563
Hawthorn and a deck chair, how

654
00:25:31,566 --> 00:25:32,136
lovely is that?

655
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,916
Okay thank you very much for watching

656
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,219
see you in the next section which

657
00:25:37,233 --> 00:25:39,873
is about real world examples, I’ll be doing

658
00:25:39,866 --> 00:25:42,386
a walk through applying all these techniques

659
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,340
and using these blocks in creating two

660
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:46,667
different types of garden, thanks
