00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,434
Greetings and welcome to section four of my online

2
00:00:03,433 --> 00:00:06,193
class ‘CAD for Gardeners’ and here I’m

3
00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:06,833
going be looking at

4
00:00:06,833 --> 00:00:09,533
a couple of real world examples. First

5
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:11,093
of all I’m looking at an

6
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:13,536
average sized garden in the UK

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,590
so that you can get an idea

8
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:17,396
of scale and how that compares to

9
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:20,443
compares with an acre which is a

10
00:00:20,466 --> 00:00:23,256
traditional UK area of land

11
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,516
Then I’ll be looking at using a

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,970
satellite photograph

13
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:29,546
a screenshot of a satellite photograph

14
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,156
as a background for a CAD

15
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:35,373
plan which works better with the larger

16
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:37,773
garden and then the actual

17
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:40,346
gardens themselves and these are real clients

18
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:42,766
that I’ve had, ones about an acre for

19
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:44,446
the garden and ones a town

20
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:47,600
garden. So the average garden in the

21
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:50,199
UK is a 188 square metres

22
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,634
apparently, according to the Office of

23
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:55,993
National Statistics. In London that’s 140

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
140 square metres and that compares

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,632
to an acre which is 4,000 square metres

26
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:02,600
and you can see here

27
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:06,083
in this image that there is the

28
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,266
one acre, the one on the left-hand

29
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:08,526
side and then this garden on the

30
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:09,853
right-hand side. Should be able to

31
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:11,373
this is a screenshot that

32
00:01:11,366 --> 00:01:12,896
I did so you can just see

33
00:01:13,266 --> 00:01:15,846
how they compare and forest

34
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:19,706
gardens do tend to be a

35
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,259
bit larger than your

36
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:24,146
average garden, mostly because they have

37
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,833
more trees and more people

38
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,723
think about them in

39
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:29,323
that way but you can have a

40
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:30,083
forest garden

41
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,230
in a small garden, it’s much more

42
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,340
about the process and the principles than

43
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,253
it is about the actual size

44
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:40,083
of the garden. So now looking at

45
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,020
a satellite photograph this is a

46
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:43,173
3D version but we're going to use

47
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,776
the 2D plan. There’s three steps

48
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:49,066
to using a satellite photograph as a

49
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:50,233
background for

50
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:52,483
your CAD plan. First one is to take

51
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,650
a screenshot, then we work out the

52
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:58,063
metres per pixel and then we import

53
00:01:58,066 --> 00:02:00,706
that image into QCAD. I’ll just quickly go

54
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,289
through that process now and I’ll be

55
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,700
going through this again later for

56
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,859
both examples. First I’ll take a

57
00:02:06,866 --> 00:02:08,666
screenshot. Make sure it’s the highest resolution

58
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,256
possible and

59
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,520
then be sure to include the

60
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,753
scale in metres, you can just about

61
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:17,533
see that down in the bottom right-hand corner

62
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:19,823
and save it as a good quality

63
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:24,723
JPEG. Then you measure the pixel length

64
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:27,556
of the metres scale, so zooming in

65
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:30,416
here, that’s 5 metres that scale at

66
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,099
the bottom and you can see it’s

67
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,590
106 pixels, so metres

68
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:36,996
per pixel, 5 metres divided by

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,279
106 pixels gives you

70
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,370
0.047 blah de blah de blah

71
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:44,465
metres per pixel and that is your

72
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:46,473
call it image scale factor, that’s how

73
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,090
much you need to scale the image down

74
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:50,713
because when you import an image

75
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:53,733
image into QCAD, it imports it at

76
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:56,283
1 metre per pixel whereas actually we’ve

77
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:58,966
got 0.047 metres per

78
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:01,456
pixel here. So that’s the reason for

79
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:03,236
scaling it and it’s really really important to

80
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:04,793
do that otherwise all your

81
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,960
measurements will be out

82
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:09,343
And then we go into QCAD

83
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:12,156
`File > Import > Select > Select All`

84
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,790
View the `Property Editor`, so that’s

85
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,939
under the `File` menu and this is

86
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:18,913
where you're bringing in the image, view

87
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,013
the `Property Editor`

88
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:22,886
which I’ve actually got locked now on the

89
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:26,286
right-hand side and you want to put

90
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,919
in the width and the height factor

91
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:30,033
you can just see down there, there’s

92
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:31,533
a width factor for the

93
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:33,453
image and the height factor and

94
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,857
in there we enter that number

95
00:03:36,866 --> 00:03:38,579
0.047 that’s a metre

96
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:40,662
that’s the image scale factor that’s metres

97
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,372
per pixel

98
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:44,126
So enter them in there

99
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:45,976
and then that image gets scaled down

100
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,970
Cool, so that’s quite straightforward steps but

101
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:52,906
can be really really useful having that

102
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,510
satellite photograph in a CAD plan because

103
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:58,323
it’s really handy guide to have. Obviously

104
00:03:58,633 --> 00:04:00,343
you want to be, you’ve got got to

105
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,503
be aware of there’s copyright issues

106
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,903
you can't use this commercially etc etc

107
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,579
but it’s handy to know how

108
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,310
to do it. Okay so I’m going

109
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,120
to jump straight over into creating the

110
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:15,693
garden acre example. Jump over into QCAD

111
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:18,069
I’ll quickly show you how to add a

112
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:20,128
template so the first thing that we

113
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:21,041
need to do is to go to

114
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:21,663
my GitHub

115
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:24,403
page github.com/growdigital/template

116
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,090
and download that

117
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,790
template, so click on `Code`, `Download ZIP`. Once

118
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,169
that has finished downloading go to your

119
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,430
download folder

120
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:38,036
and unzip it

121
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,719
unzip it there, I’m going to rename it

122
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:44,223
template just to keep things tidy

123
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:48,493
Going to cut that and I have created

124
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:50,996
in my documents folder I have

125
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,490
created a QCAD folder and that’s

126
00:04:53,466 --> 00:04:55,836
where I’m gonna put my templates so

127
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:58,603
paste that in there. Now I need

128
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,070
to go back into QCAD

129
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:06,703
and then under `Edit > Application Preferences > File

130
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:10,003
and Templates` I need to add that

131
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,200
folder, so go into my Documents folder

132
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:18,913
into QCAD, into template and then

133
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:21,543
choose that one, click `OK` it says

134
00:05:21,566 --> 00:05:23,816
you need to restart so we will restart

135
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,340
QCAD

136
00:05:25,766 --> 00:05:28,706
and now when you go `File > New

137
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,750
From Template`

138
00:05:30,966 --> 00:05:33,216
you will see that you have the

139
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:37,373
default folder here, click on `Template`

140
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,050
`Create New Drawing` there we go and

141
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:43,153
it’s got all the layers in there

142
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,786
as well. So I’m just going to save

143
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:46,326
that first of all into the garden

144
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:50,953
acre folder, save as and

145
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:53,696
and, where are we? We're here so

146
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:57,093
call that garden-acre and save

147
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:58,656
that in there. The next thing I

148
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,076
want to do is to bring in

149
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:03,703
that satellite photograph so I’ve opened up

150
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:06,343
GNU Image Manipulation Program which is

151
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,303
like Photoshop, because I’m on Linux I

152
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,713
don’t have Photoshop anymore

153
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:14,556
use the marquee tool and I’ll select

154
00:06:14,566 --> 00:06:17,836
that area there and that then gives

155
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,143
me down here, gives us the size

156
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:22,053
of a 114 so that’s

157
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:25,276
10 metres divided by a 114

158
00:06:25,266 --> 00:06:28,896
pixels and that’s metres per pixel

159
00:06:28,966 --> 00:06:31,276
so 10 metres divided by 114

160
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,059
is 0.08771…

161
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,350
etc so I’ll just

162
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:39,043
save that number and then I’ll use

163
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:41,073
that number when I scale down the

164
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,220
image. So go back into CAD, go

165
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:49,243
`File > Import` garden acre and satellite, so

166
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:50,346
bring that straight in

167
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,359
oops, okay, and you can see it’s

168
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,913
really really really really really big. What

169
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,133
I want to do is to put

170
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:00,053
that into the xSatellite layer, so it’s

171
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:03,123
right at the back, that layer down the bottom

172
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:05,175
this is the reason

173
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,634
for having layers is that you

174
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:08,253
can just put different stuff on different

175
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:09,946
layers and keep it locked up and

176
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:11,583
tidied away. So now I

177
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,399
need to scale this image down

178
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,993
to the right metres per pixel, it’s

179
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,380
being brought in at 1 meter per pixel

180
00:07:16,366 --> 00:07:18,256
and I need it to be much

181
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:20,830
considerably smaller, so make sure it’s selected

182
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,998
and then I go to that width

183
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,072
factor and the height factor, let me

184
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,420
just pull it over here a little

185
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,740
bit so you can see, so width

186
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:32,733
factor I’ll place in the metres per

187
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:36,063
pixel which are calculated from the Photoshop

188
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:39,096
file and I’ll paste in that number there

189
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:42,076
and there we go that’s much more

190
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:46,806
to scale, okay. Another handy little hint

191
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,659
quite often when you bring in new

192
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,736
images and new elements they’ll sit on

193
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:52,893
top of everything else so if you

194
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,539
go to `Modify` and then the `Draw Order`

195
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:57,093
you can send it to the

196
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,630
back and that means that you then

197
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,169
get to see other bits and pieces

198
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,756
like the legend I’ve got down here.

199
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:04,683
So, I’ve created a template, got the

200
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,707
satellite image in and now I’m going to

201
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,912
create the boundary, so back into QCAD

202
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:12,243
click on the boundary layer because

203
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:13,014
this is where I’m going to be

204
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:15,103
drawing the boundary and this is a

205
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,080
lovely house, I just I do like

206
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,699
it, it’s a nice little job

207
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,996
I wanted to do a a water garden

208
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,220
And I’m going to use `Snap Free`

209
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,650
yep, and then I’m using the

210
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:32,923
line tool here and `Snap Free` and

211
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:34,613
then I’m going to trace an outline

212
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,400
and it’s this field you know this

213
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:38,176
field here, I’m going

214
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,666
to trace an outline around it. It’s

215
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:40,566
not going to be particularly

216
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:43,063
accurate or particularly pretty but just gives

217
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:45,016
you an idea. I could be

218
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:47,553
using curves for this as well. I

219
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:49,084
could be doing it accurately too!

220
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:54,826
There we go and then `Snap Auto` because I

221
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,152
want to snap onto the end of

222
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:58,172
that bit there okay. There we go

223
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:00,153
hit escape go back to the arrow

224
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:03,373
tool. Ah what you can do brilliantly

225
00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:05,233
really nice little feature you can lock

226
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:07,423
layers so I’m going to lock that satellite layer

227
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:09,256
and then go back to my boundary layer

228
00:09:09,366 --> 00:09:10,386
This means I don’t pick up

229
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,646
the satellite photo by accident

230
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:15,493
Now we’ve got that if I

231
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,719
hide, you click on the eye

232
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,536
it hides a layer so I’ll just

233
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:21,363
hide that layer and you can see

234
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,559
that’s the line that we’ve drawn around

235
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:25,186
it. So now

236
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,033
if I double-click on it, it selects

237
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:29,142
it, it gives you the

238
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:32,104
total length here but it doesn't

239
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:35,403
give you the area so what I’m

240
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,599
going to do is make it into

241
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,310
a polyline which is what I showed you

242
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,370
earlier on so double-click

243
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,079
selects all the items, `Draw > Polyline >

244
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,449
Polyline From Selection`

245
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,240
And now when I click on it

246
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,780
it gives us an area so that’s

247
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:57,406
3,127m²

248
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,409
so basically that’s three quarters of an

249
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,893
acre which is a fair sized, nice

250
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,860
sized garden

251
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:06,316
I’ll bring the satellite back so we

252
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,253
can see. So next I’m going to

253
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,373
put some paths in

254
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:13,746
and I’ll just do this on

255
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:15,625
the areas. I’m just going to use

256
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:16,860
a line tool, I’m not

257
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,099
going do anything really fancy, so line tool

258
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:22,413
this one here and I know that

259
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,280
there’s an entrance here, I’ll snap onto

260
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:27,360
the entity so that I know that

261
00:10:27,366 --> 00:10:29,892
it snaps actually onto that line, I think

262
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,813
the path is around about there and

263
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:36,859
I go `Snap Auto` turns it off and

264
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:38,256
I think they want a

265
00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:40,006
path going around here

266
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,620
round the top

267
00:10:44,366 --> 00:10:46,346
and there’s another exit out there, so

268
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,603
`Snap onto Entity` to snap up to

269
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:50,887
there, there we go

270
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,650
We now have a path going around

271
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,493
the edge. Turn off the satellite so

272
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:57,913
you can see the path. What I

273
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,870
will do is to offset this so

274
00:11:00,866 --> 00:11:02,216
you get much more the idea of

275
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:04,123
a path, so using the offset tool

276
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,990
you can draw one line for your

277
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,859
path and then you can offset it

278
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,346
both sides or one side and

279
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,053
then it creates

280
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:14,140
the path itself but the size of

281
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,449
your path depends on how wide

282
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:16,963
you want it but if it’s about

283
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,550
a metre, a metre’s a nice big comfortable path

284
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,240
down to about 0.4 metres

285
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:22,706
for a single person to walk along

286
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:23,933
so it depends where the path is and

287
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,863
how you’re using it and so let’s hit escape

288
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,233
go into the modification tools and then offset

289
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,613
and I’ll offset 0.3 metres

290
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,346
on each side I’ll just zoom in

291
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:40,646
so offset it on that side and

292
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,963
offset it on that side, okay and

293
00:11:43,966 --> 00:11:46,126
then I’m going to delete the middle

294
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:47,243
bit. And then you’ve got a nice

295
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:49,393
little path. Now you could do this using

296
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,320
the NURBS tool as well. Then next

297
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,323
up, I want to

298
00:11:52,366 --> 00:11:54,676
put the trees in so let’s go

299
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:57,583
and grab some trees from the forest

300
00:11:57,566 --> 00:12:00,536
garden blocks. Go back up here, blocks

301
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:05,063
forest garden canopy and let’s get a selection

302
00:12:05,066 --> 00:12:09,116
of trees. Cornus capitata, Cornel…

303
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:12,196
Cornus capitata, click that button there

304
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:16,556
check that one Bentham's Cornel, Cornus kousa

305
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,389
just escape that, Cornus kousa, click on

306
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,540
the insert block button, it’s a Chinese Dogwood

307
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,499
I’ve got to have a hawthorn

308
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:31,513
Crataegus schraderiana

309
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,703
insert block, Blue Hawthorn

310
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,379
and then I always always always have to

311
00:12:40,366 --> 00:12:42,256
have a Sweet Chestnut, actually a Sweet

312
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:44,936
Chestnut won't work because I know it’s

313
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:47,213
a damp, oh I’ll put a Sweet Chestnut on anyway

314
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:49,816
let’s pretend it’s not damp there, Sweet

315
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,003
Chestnuts don’t like heavy clay soils

316
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:52,873
and I know it’s a heavy

317
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,130
clay soil there so it won't do

318
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:56,143
very well. I’ll just cut them

319
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,013
and I’ll go over to the tree

320
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:03,783
layer in the `Layers List` and

321
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:06,946
then paste and there we go, look

322
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:09,186
at that, fantastic and then you move the

323
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,636
trees around so that they’re in

324
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,249
the right position

325
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:15,396
they've got enough spacing and there’s enough

326
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:17,353
there’s enough spacing around between

327
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:18,836
the trees and enough light getting through

328
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,323
to the bottom canopy floor layer

329
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:26,663
Okay now I’m going to put

330
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:30,686
in some hedgerows, some hedges so let’s

331
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:31,603
open up

332
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,630
the shrub document from the forest garden

333
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:36,323
plants

334
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:40,273
and we’ll have a hedge of

335
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:45,733
Ligustrum vulgare

336
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,520
this is a Wild Privet really really

337
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:52,766
good wildlife plant, Privet, Ligustrum vulgare

338
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,189
and we go back here and paste

339
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,560
it in

340
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,940
and this forms part of the

341
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:04,346
design side of things is what

342
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:06,916
height windbreak you should have

343
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:08,403
So on the northside you can see, down

344
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,410
here you’ve got north-east-west and

345
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,289
south, on the north side you want

346
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,537
the tallest wind breaks along there and

347
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,826
also because that is a road

348
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,573
there as well you want a

349
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:21,793
big tall I would have put a

350
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,439
double thickness windbreak along there, you're

351
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:26,293
not going to lose any light, you

352
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,769
get much more protection and you make

353
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,406
it thick and right cut down on

354
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:31,663
the amount of road noise that you

355
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:34,993
get. So Ligustrum vulgare is actually

356
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,467
not that tall so I wouldn't have

357
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,986
it, 1.5 metres

358
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,230
I thought it would be bigger

359
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:41,033
than that, to 1.5 to

360
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:41,906
2 metres

361
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,050
so that’s a kind of hedge you'd

362
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:46,896
have on the south side. So the

363
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,780
most valuable sunlight comes from the south

364
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:52,226
and the west that the air has

365
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:53,463
had a time to warm up in

366
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:55,686
the afternoon so that the afternoon

367
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,456
sunlight is more valuable, there’s more photosynthesis

368
00:14:58,466 --> 00:14:59,846
apparently than in the

369
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,693
morning. I want to put them onto the

370
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,450
shrub layer

371
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,096
I put one there

372
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:06,596
and then one there

373
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:10,153
okay

374
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:17,403
And then to make it a windbreak

375
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,230
hedge all that I do

376
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:22,693
it’s three metres diameter

377
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,183
all that I’m going do now is

378
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,496
to draw a line between them, right

379
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,089
in the centre, the central points, it

380
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,320
should automatically snap to the reference point

381
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,139
which is in the middle

382
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:38,997
from one to the other. Hit escape and

383
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,296
now I’m going to use the offset

384
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,159
tool to put the two sides of

385
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:44,113
the hedge on. So the same

386
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:46,173
kind of principle as creating a path

387
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:50,213
so modification tools, offset tool and I

388
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:52,393
know that the width of the Privet

389
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:54,526
hedge will be 3 metres diameter

390
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:56,873
or 3 metres width, so it’s

391
00:15:56,866 --> 00:15:58,786
1.5 metres for one side

392
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,510
1.5 metres for the other side

393
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,389
So a distance 1.5

394
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,690
bomp and that one bomp

395
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,100
Delete the middle one now

396
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,719
There you go, we now have

397
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:15,283
a windbreak. And then I would

398
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,906
do wind breaks around the

399
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,030
edges. A big part of the design

400
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:22,286
is figuring out how the different areas

401
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,339
are going to be used and a

402
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,013
fundamental element of that design which I

403
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:30,443
cover in my design class is creating

404
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,960
the areas through the use of paths

405
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,899
So you create

406
00:16:33,966 --> 00:16:36,015
the paths first, you create the structure

407
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,099
of the garden first of all and

408
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,629
then you can bring in the different

409
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:41,703
planting around and the features around that

410
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:45,563
okay so what I would do

411
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,223
after this I would create

412
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:50,153
different windbreaks all the way around so

413
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,426
you would always want to have

414
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:53,623
windbreaks surrounding your garden to reduce

415
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,640
the amount of turbulence particularly with

416
00:16:55,633 --> 00:16:58,063
the Climate Emergency because there’s going to

417
00:16:58,066 --> 00:16:59,746
be more and more extreme weather events

418
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,565
There we go and that’s that

419
00:17:02,566 --> 00:17:05,476
one done. And now onto creating the

420
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:06,823
garden town

421
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,779
So as I said before, the satellite

422
00:17:09,766 --> 00:17:11,356
really is just a rough guide. I’ll

423
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,200
do it from the satellite now but what

424
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,310
you want to be doing is creating

425
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,979
your plan from actual measurements on the

426
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,940
ground and just get general information from

427
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:20,485
the maps, okay, so this is what

428
00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:22,604
we're going to be doing so let’s go

429
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:24,853
and create a new file, save that

430
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,323
one, create a new file from template

431
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:31,323
And I’m going to save that as garden

432
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:35,266
town, okay, go up the level, garden town

433
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,639
and this is garden town,

434
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:38,113
garden-town

435
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,070
great stuff then go over to

436
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,850
my image bitmap editor, zoom down

437
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:47,376
here

438
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,690
Use a rectangular marquee tool and select that

439
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:56,163
and you can see that the width

440
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,756
the marquee is a 110 pixels

441
00:17:57,733 --> 00:18:01,303
so that is 5 metres and

442
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,013
110 pixels that’s

443
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:05,583
5 divided by 110 gives

444
00:18:05,566 --> 00:18:07,846
you your metres per pixel, so

445
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:12,176
5 divided by 110

446
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:13,283
gives you that.

447
00:18:14,466 --> 00:18:17,766
Lovely. And now go back into QCAD

448
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:25,150
select the satellite layer, file import and

449
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,889
it’s going to make me go all the

450
00:18:26,866 --> 00:18:28,186
way back obviously

451
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:32,113
examples, garden town, satellite

452
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,680
pop that in there

453
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,090
See, really really really big it is

454
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,146
Let’s select it and then the width

455
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,749
factor, whoops, I’ll just pop that up here

456
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:44,153
for you

457
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,169
that’s the width factor here, so paste

458
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,696
in that value which is the metres

459
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,590
per pixel, paste that value in there

460
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,320
and you can see it shrinks right the

461
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,123
way down, weeee, that’s better, and now

462
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:59,353
it’s to scale and then just to

463
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,443
get it, can you see

464
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:06,186
`Modify > Draw Order > Send to Back`

465
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,546
and then you can see

466
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:08,743
the

467
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,606
compass, the legend there as well lovely

468
00:19:13,633 --> 00:19:14,563
I’ll lock that layer

469
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,446
So this is a friend's garden in

470
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,920
North London, I worked on a few

471
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,620
years ago now

472
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,350
okay, going to pop the `Property Editor`

473
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,733
there and it’s this one here, so

474
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:28,993
I’m just going to do this really

475
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,090
really really basically so start off with

476
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,730
the boundary so select the boundary layer

477
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,353
click on the line tool, this one

478
00:19:39,366 --> 00:19:40,986
the only one I ever use

479
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,898
`LI` and then we’ll just click

480
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:50,946
click, click, click, click, and that’s it

481
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,173
double-click it and you can see

482
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,726
if I just turn off the satellite

483
00:19:55,766 --> 00:19:57,746
that’s it, it’s a bit rough and ready

484
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,010
double-click it and then we’ll turn

485
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,373
that into a polyline and then we

486
00:20:03,366 --> 00:20:05,706
can see how big it is, so

487
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:07,653
`Draw Polyline From Selection`

488
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:11,546
and that gives me an area of

489
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:14,473
102 metres, so that’s

490
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,940
how big their garden is

491
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:17,283
so it’s a bit under the

492
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:20,533
average, the average for a UK London garden

493
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:23,473
is a 140 square metres

494
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:25,273
and theirs comes in at just over

495
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,866
100 square metres okay

496
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:31,176
so then what I would do is

497
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,546
to put the path in

498
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,306
in areas and this is where sometimes

499
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,383
you want to change the colours of

500
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:39,716
your layers so you can actually see

501
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:40,723
what's going on, as you can see

502
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,079
from this you can hardly,

503
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,810
you can't actually see the red

504
00:20:44,233 --> 00:20:46,063
on that boundary on this particular image

505
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,030
so this is where you would play

506
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:49,953
around with the different colours, so we’ll get

507
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:52,183
the, ah the kitchen door is around

508
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,040
about here somewhere

509
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:55,666
and say oh we want a new

510
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,466
path and that path goes up to

511
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:57,766
here

512
00:20:58,833 --> 00:20:59,613
up to the shed

513
00:21:01,733 --> 00:21:02,303
okay

514
00:21:03,966 --> 00:21:05,976
let’s just turn off that satellite

515
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:06,896
so you can see what's going on

516
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,920
so that’s my path

517
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,520
I’ll make it into a polyline so it’s

518
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,799
easier to use so `Draw > Polyline

519
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,620
Polyline From Selection` and that sets it as

520
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:18,070
a group

521
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:20,906
and then

522
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,220
oh let’s go and put the the

523
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,729
shed in, there’s a shed down here

524
00:21:25,733 --> 00:21:28,493
in the bottom left-hand corner so

525
00:21:29,866 --> 00:21:31,576
I’ll go into my shape tools

526
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,376
and I’ll just draw it freehand

527
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,789
so `Snap Free` so it

528
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:42,466
doesn't snap onto anything else

529
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:47,385
I’ll do that there, there we go I’ve

530
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,380
gone and drawn it into the

531
00:21:49,366 --> 00:21:53,626
areas layer, so how you move

532
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:55,793
it in the `Property Editor` is to

533
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,480
select the thing that you want

534
00:21:57,466 --> 00:22:00,166
to move and then change the

535
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,590
the layer that it’s in. I

536
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,859
want to put it into the Structures

537
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:05,336
layer and there you will see, it will

538
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,573
automatically change colour down here, we just

539
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,979
turn off the satellite so you can

540
00:22:08,966 --> 00:22:12,086
see, okay? Double-click it, I’ll turn it

541
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,799
into a block actually `Create Block

542
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,490
From Selection`

543
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:20,143
Okay and I’m going to call that shed and

544
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:20,856
then you’ll see

545
00:22:24,566 --> 00:22:27,446
the shed will appear here in the

546
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:29,083
`Block List`, okay?

547
00:22:32,566 --> 00:22:34,726
And then it’s the same principle now

548
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:37,163
as well for putting in trees and

549
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,870
shrubs I’ve got my forest

550
00:22:39,866 --> 00:22:41,756
garden plants blocks here, I’ll put up

551
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:45,763
a hazel down here, Corylus avellana so

552
00:22:45,766 --> 00:22:47,476
the big name’s the common name

553
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,379
and then the botanical name’s underneath

554
00:22:51,033 --> 00:22:52,562
and the botanical names is

555
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:53,887
in the list, in the `Layer List`

556
00:22:54,066 --> 00:22:55,087
so let’s cut that

557
00:22:56,366 --> 00:22:59,096
go over to the garden town go

558
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,058
to shrub

559
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:04,503
paste it in there, wow, much much

560
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,540
bigger it’s a town garden so the

561
00:23:08,266 --> 00:23:10,876
trees obviously much larger size, so there

562
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,860
we go and then you can do

563
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:14,653
that with individual beds with the paths

564
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,440
putting plants in, putting different features in

565
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:21,342
greenhouses, patios, all that kind

566
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:22,927
of stuff, then you start to build

567
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,789
up the design for the garden but

568
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,961
as I said before, the most important

569
00:23:26,966 --> 00:23:29,486
thing when you're creating these designs is

570
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,199
to get the spacing right between the

571
00:23:32,633 --> 00:23:34,583
trees, make sure that they've

572
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,159
got the paths in the right

573
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:38,654
place, so getting the structure in the

574
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:41,344
The smaller planting is much much easier

575
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:41,512
to do

576
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,241
on-site so you don’t have

577
00:23:43,266 --> 00:23:44,976
to be so precise about

578
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:47,066
the designs for them but

579
00:23:47,066 --> 00:23:49,015
it’s really really important to get the

580
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,040
trees and the paths and the main

581
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:53,857
structures in place first. And that brings us

582
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,409
to a close and what I also have

583
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,879
a whole load of resources, so there’s the

584
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,681
link for downloading

585
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,675
QCAD, they've got the CAD files

586
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,240
for this class, I’ve also created

587
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:10,432
a public Telegram group called Garden Wild Edible

588
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:12,333
which goes along with these classes

589
00:24:12,566 --> 00:24:14,066
and that’s a space if you want

590
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:16,976
to ask any questions, then feel free

591
00:24:16,966 --> 00:24:18,599
to join and then ask questions

592
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,467
if you’ve got any questions about QCAD

593
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:21,826
kind of technical

594
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,513
stuff then there’s a QCAD

595
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,080
link to QCAD forum, there’s my template

596
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,549
my delicious CAD template file

597
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:31,933
native plants spreadsheet which I haven't shown

598
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:33,103
you which I ought to show you

599
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,270
and the forest garden spreadsheet

600
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,520
I will be using these more

601
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,956
in the design section of

602
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,699
the classes. So the Garden Wild Spreadsheet

603
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,013
is a list of native plants, it’s

604
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,620
flowers just at the moment, I’ve got

605
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,809
space for other native forms but the

606
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,666
Forest Garden Spreadsheet is a list of

607
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:56,316
all the forest garden plants in

608
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,129
Martin Crawford's book as well so loads and

609
00:24:58,133 --> 00:25:00,653
loads of information there and then you’ve

610
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,166
got my CAD blocks too

611
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:03,816
That draws us to an end

612
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,020
I hope that’s useful, if you do want

613
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:07,323
to get in touch with me, my

614
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,249
email address is here

00:25:09,266 --> 00:25:10,676
hello@natureworks.org.uk and you

616
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:12,106
can sign up for my newsletter as

617
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,018
